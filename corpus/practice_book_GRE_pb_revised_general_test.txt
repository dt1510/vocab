Unlike the previous paper-based GRE General
Test and the GRE Subject Tests, which use separate
answer sheets, the paper-based GRE revised General
Test is self-contained: you will enter all responses for
the Analytical Writing tasks and the Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning questions in the
test book itself. Also, you are allowed to use a basic
hand-held calculator on the Quantitative Reasoning
sections. The calculator will be provided to you at the
test site; you may not use your own calculator. Information about using the calculator to help you answer
questions appears on page 32.

Preparing for the GRE revised
General Test
Preparation for the test will depend on the amount
of time you have available and your personal preferences for how to prepare. At a minimum, before you
take the paper-based GRE revised General Test, you
should know what to expect from the test, including
the administrative procedures, types of questions and
directions, number of questions and amount of time
for each section.
The administrative procedures include registration and appointment scheduling, date, time, test
center location, cost, score-reporting procedures and
availability of special testing arrangements. You can
find out about the administrative procedures for the
revised General Test in the GRE Information and
Registration Bulletin. Information is also available
online at www.ets.org/gre/general or by contacting
ETS at 1-609-771-7670 or 1-866-473-4373 (toll free
for test takers in the U.S., American Samoa, Guam,
Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada).
Before taking the practice revised General Test,
it is important to become familiar with the content
of each of the measures. In this publication, you will
find information specific to each measure of the test.
You can use this information to understand the type

4

of material on which you will be tested and the question types within each measure. Determine which
strategies work best for you. Remember—you can do
very well on the test without answering every question in each section correctly.

Test-taking Strategies
Analytical Writing Measure
Everyone—even the most practiced and confident of
writers—should spend some time preparing for the
Analytical Writing measure before arriving at the
test center. It is important to understand the skills
measured and how the tasks are scored. It is also useful to review the scoring guides, sample topics, scored
sample essay responses and reader commentary for
each task.
The tasks in the Analytical Writing measure
relate to a broad range of subjects—from the fine arts
and humanities to the social and physical sciences—
but no task requires specific content knowledge. In
fact, each task has been tested by actual GRE test
takers to ensure that it possesses several important
characteristics, including the following:
• GRE test takers, regardless of their field of study
or special interests, understood the task and
could easily respond to it.
• The task elicited the kinds of complex thinking
and persuasive writing that university faculty
consider important for success in graduate
school.
• The responses were varied in content and in the
way the writers developed their ideas.
To help you prepare for the Analytical Writing measure, the GRE Program has published the entire pool
of tasks from which your test tasks will be selected.
You might find it helpful to review the Issue and
Argument pools. You can view the published pools at
www.ets.org/gre/awtopics.
Before taking the Analytical Writing measure,
review the strategies, sample topics, essay responses
and reader commentary for each task contained in
this document. Also review the scoring guides for
each task. This will give you a deeper understanding
of how readers evaluate essays and the elements they
are looking for in an essay.
In the paper-based revised General Test, the topics
in the Analytical Writing measure will be presented
in the test book, and you will handwrite your essay
responses in the test book in the space provided.

It is important to budget your time. Within the
30-minute time limit for the Issue task, you will need
to allow sufficient time to consider the issue and the
specific instructions, plan a response and compose
your essay. Within the 30-minute time limit for the
Argument task, you will need to allow sufficient time
to consider the argument and the specific instructions,
plan a response and compose your essay. Although
the GRE readers who score your essays understand
the time constraints under which you write and will
consider your response a first draft, you still want it to
be the best possible example of your writing that you
can produce under the testing conditions.
Save a few minutes at the end of each section to
check for obvious errors. Although an occasional
spelling or grammatical error will not affect your
score, severe and persistent errors will detract from
the overall effectiveness of your writing and lower
your score accordingly.
Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning
Measures
The questions in the Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning measures have a variety of formats.
Some require you to select a single answer choice;
others require you to select one or more answer
choices, and yet others require you to enter a numeric
answer. Make sure when answering a question that
you understand what response is required. Complete
instructions for answering each question type are
included in the practice test after the two Analytical
Writing tasks.
When taking a Verbal Reasoning or Quantitative
Reasoning section, you are free, within that section,
to skip questions that you might have difficulty answering and come back to them later during the time
provided to work on that section. Also during that
time you may change the answer to any question in
that section by erasing it completely and filling in an
alternative answer. Be careful not to leave any stray
marks in the answer area, as they may be interpreted
as incorrect responses. You can, however, safely make
notes or perform calculations on other parts of the
page. No additional scratch paper will be provided.
Your Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning scores will be determined by the number of questions for which you select or provide the best answer.
Questions for which you mark no answer or more
or fewer than the requested number of answers are

not counted in scoring. Nothing is subtracted from a
score if you answer a question incorrectly. Therefore,
to maximize your scores on the Verbal Reasoning and
Quantitative Reasoning measures of the paper-based
test, it is best to answer every question.
Work as rapidly as you can without being careless.
Since no question carries greater weight than any
other, do not waste time pondering individual questions you find extremely difficult or unfamiliar.
You may want to go through a section rapidly at
first, stopping only to answer those questions you can
do so with certainty. Then go back and answer the
questions that require greater thought, concluding
with the difficult questions if you have time.
Note: During the actual administration of the revised
General Test, you may work only on the section the
test center supervisor designates and only for the time
allowed. You may not go back to an earlier section of
the test after the supervisor announces, “Please stop
work” for that section. The supervisor is authorized to
dismiss you from the center for doing so. All answers
must be recorded in the test book.

Breaks
There is a 10-minute break following the second
Analytical Writing section.

Scoring and Score Reporting
Analytical Writing Measure
For the Analytical Writing measure, each essay receives a score from two readers using a six-point
holistic scale. In holistic scoring, readers are trained
to assign scores based on the overall quality of an
essay in response to the assigned task. If the two
scores differ by more than one point on the scale,
the discrepancy is adjudicated by a third GRE reader.
Otherwise, the two scores on each essay are averaged.
The final score on the two essays are then averaged and rounded to the nearest half-point interval
on the 0-6 score scale. A single score is reported for
the Analytical Writing measure.
The primary emphasis in scoring the Analytical
Writing measure is on your critical thinking and
analytical writing skills. Scoring guides for the Issue
and Argument prompts are included in this publication in Appendix A on pages 94–97 and available at
www.ets.org/gre/scoreguides.

Independent Intellectual Activity

Score Reporting

During the scoring process for the GRE revised
General Test, essay responses on the Analytical
Writing measure are reviewed by ETS
essay-similarity-detection software and by
experienced essay readers. In light of the high value
placed on independent intellectual activity within
graduate schools and universities, ETS reserves the
right to cancel test scores of any test taker when an
essay response includes any of the following:

The scores for the GRE revised General Test include:

• text that is unusually similar to that found in
one or more other GRE essay responses
• quoting or paraphrasing, without attribution,
language that appears in published or
unpublished sources
• unacknowledged use of work that has been
produced through collaboration with others
without citation of the contribution of others
• essays submitted as work of the test taker that
appear to have been borrowed in whole or in
part from elsewhere or prepared by another
person
When one or more of the above circumstances occurs, ETS may conclude, in its professional judgment,
that the essay response does not reflect the independent writing skills that this test seeks to measure.
When ETS reaches that conclusion, it cancels the
Analytical Writing score; because Analytical Writing
scores are an integral part of the GRE revised General Test scores, those scores are canceled as well.
Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning
Measures
Scoring of the Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative
Reasoning measures is essentially a two-step process.
First a raw score is computed for each measure. The
raw score for each measure is the number of questions
answered correctly.
The Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning raw scores are then converted to scaled scores
through a process known as equating. The equating
process accounts for minor variations in difficulty
among the different test editions. Thus, a given
scaled score for a particular measure reflects the same
level of performance regardless of which edition of
the test that was taken.

6

• a Verbal Reasoning score reported on a 130–170
score scale, in one-point increments
• a Quantitative Reasoning score reported on a
130–170 score scale, in one-point increments
• an Analytical Writing score reported on a 0–6
score scale, in half-point increments
If no questions are answered for a specific measure
(e.g., Verbal Reasoning), then you will receive a
No Score (NS) for that measure.
Descriptions of the analytical writing abilities
characteristic of particular score levels are available
in Appendix A on page 98.
Score-Reporting Timeframes
Scores on the paper-based GRE revised General Test
are reported approximately six weeks after the test
date. For specific information on score reporting
dates for paper-based administrations, visit
www.ets.org/gre/score/dates.
Your scores are reportable for the five testing
years following the year in which you test. For more
information about GRE score reporting, visit
www.ets.org/gre/scores/get.

Introduction to the
Analytical Writing Measure
The Analytical Writing measure tests your critical
thinking and analytical writing skills. It assesses your
ability to articulate and support complex ideas, construct and evaluate arguments, and sustain a focused
and coherent discussion. It does not assess specific
content knowledge.
The Analytical Writing measure consists of two
separately timed analytical writing tasks:
• a 30-minute “Analyze an Issue” task
• a 30-minute “Analyze an Argument” task
The Issue task presents an opinion on an issue of general interest followed by specific instructions on how
to respond to that issue. You are required to evaluate
the issue, consider its complexities and develop an
argument with reasons and examples to support your
views.

The Argument task requires you to evaluate a
given argument according to specific instructions.
You will need to consider the logical soundness of the
argument rather than agree or disagree with the position it presents.
The two tasks are complementary in that one
requires you to construct your own argument by
taking a position and providing evidence supporting
your views on an issue, and the other requires you
to evaluate someone else’s argument by assessing its
claims and evaluating the evidence it provides.

Analyze an Issue Task
The Analyze an Issue task assesses your ability to
think critically about a topic of general interest and
to clearly express your thoughts about it in writing.
Each Issue topic makes a claim that test takers can
discuss from various perspectives and apply to many
different situations or conditions. Your task is to present a compelling case for your own position on the
issue. Before beginning your written response, be sure
to read the issue and the instructions that follow the
Issue statement. Think about the issue from several
points of view, considering the complexity of ideas
associated with those views. Then, make notes about
the position you want to develop and list the main
reasons and examples you could use to support that
position.
It is important that you address the central issue
according to the specific instructions. Each Issue
Topic is accompanied by one of the following sets of
instructions:
• Write a response in which you discuss the extent
to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your
position, you should consider ways in which
the statement might or might not hold true and
explain how these considerations shape your
position.
• Write a response in which you discuss the extent
to which you agree or disagree with the recommendation and explain your reasoning for the
position you take. In developing and supporting
your position, describe specific circumstances
in which adopting the recommendation would
or would not be advantageous and explain how
these examples shape your position.
• Write a response in which you discuss the extent
to which you agree or disagree with the claim.

In developing and supporting your position, be
sure to address the most compelling reasons
and/or examples that could be used to challenge
your position.
• Write a response in which you discuss which
view more closely aligns with your own position and explain your reasoning for the position
you take. In developing and supporting your
position, you should address both of the views
presented.
• Write a response in which you discuss the extent
to which you agree or disagree with the claim
and the reason on which that claim is based.
• Write a response in which you discuss your views
on the policy and explain your reasoning for the
position you take. In developing and supporting
your position, you should consider the possible
consequences of implementing the policy and
explain how these consequences shape your
position.
The GRE readers scoring your response are not looking for a “right” answer—in fact, as far as they are
concerned, there is no correct position to take. Instead, the readers are evaluating the skill with which
you address the specific instructions and articulate
and develop an argument to support your evaluation
of the issue.
Understanding the Context for Writing: Purpose
and Audience
The Analyze an Issue task is an exercise in critical
thinking and persuasive writing. The purpose of
this task is to determine how well you can develop a
compelling argument supporting your own evaluation
of an issue and then effectively communicate that
argument in writing to an academic audience. Your
audience consists of GRE readers who are carefully
trained to apply the scoring criteria identified in the
scoring guide for the Analyze an Issue task in
Appendix A on pages 94–95.
To get a clearer idea of how GRE readers apply the
Issue scoring criteria to actual responses, you should
review scored sample Issue essay responses and reader
commentary. The sample responses, particularly at
the 5 and 6 score levels, will show you a variety of
successful strategies for organizing, developing and
communicating a persuasive argument. The reader
commentary discusses specific aspects of evaluation
and writing, such as the use of examples, development and support, organization, language fluency

7

and word choice. For each response, the commentary
points out aspects that are particularly persuasive as
well as any that detract from the overall effectiveness
of the essay.
Preparing for the Issue Task
Since the Issue task is meant to assess the persuasive
writing skills you have developed throughout your
education, it has been designed neither to require any
particular course of study nor to advantage students
with a particular type of training.
Many college textbooks on composition offer
advice on persuasive writing and argumentation that
you might find useful, but even this advice might be
more technical and specialized than you need for the
Issue task. You will not be expected to know specific
critical thinking or writing terms or strategies; instead, you should be able to respond to the specific
instructions and use reasons, evidence and examples
to support your position on an issue.
Suppose, for instance, that an Issue topic asks you
to consider a policy that would require government
financial support for art museums and the implications of implementing the policy. If your position is
that government should fund art museums, you might
support your position by discussing the reasons art
is important and explain that government funding
would make access to museums available to everyone.
On the other hand, if your position is that government should not support museums, you might point
out that art museums are not as deserving of limited
governmental funding as are other, more socially important institutions, which would suffer if the policy
were implemented. Or, if you are in favor of government funding for art museums only under certain
conditions, you might focus on the artistic criteria,
cultural concerns or political conditions that you
think should determine how, or whether, art museums receive government funds. It is not your position
that matters as much as the critical thinking skills
you display in developing your position.
An excellent way to prepare for the Issue task is
to practice writing on some of the published topics.
There is no “best” approach: some people prefer to
start practicing without regard to the 30-minute time
limit; others prefer to take a “timed test” first and
practice within the time limit. Regardless of which
approach you take, you should first review the task
directions and then follow these steps:

8

• Carefully read the claim and the specific instructions and make sure you understand them; if
they seem unclear, discuss them with a friend
or teacher.
• Think about the claim and instructions in
relation to your own ideas and experiences, to
events you have read about or observed and to
people you have known; this is the knowledge
base from which you will develop compelling
reasons and examples in your argument that reinforce, negate or qualify the claim in some way.
• Decide what position on the issue you want to
take and defend.
• Decide what compelling evidence (reasons and
examples) you can use to support your position.
Remember that this is a task in critical thinking and
persuasive writing. The most successful responses will
explore the complexity of the claim and follow the
specific task instructions. As you prepare for the Issue
task, you might find it helpful to ask yourself the following questions:
• What, precisely, is the central issue?
• What precisely are the instructions asking me to
do?
• Do I agree with all or any part of the claim?
Why or why not?
• Does the claim make certain assumptions? If so,
are they reasonable?
• Is the claim valid only under certain conditions?
If so, what are they?
• Do I need to explain how I interpret certain
terms or concepts used in the claim?
• If I take a certain position on the issue, what
reasons support my position?
• What examples—either real or hypothetical
—could I use to illustrate those reasons and
advance my point of view? Which examples are
most compelling?
Once you have decided on a position to defend, consider the perspectives of others who might not agree
with your position. Ask yourself:
• What reasons might someone use to refute or
undermine my position?
• How should I acknowledge or defend against
those views in my essay?
To plan your response, you might want to summarize
your position and make notes about how you will
support it. When you’ve done this, look over your

notes and decide how you will organize your response.
Then write a response developing your position on
the issue. Even if you don’t write a full response, you
should find it helpful to practice with a few of the
Issue topics and to sketch out your possible responses.
After you have practiced with some of the topics, try writing responses to some of them within the
30-minute time limit so that you have a good idea of
how to use your time in the actual test.
It would probably be helpful to get some feedback
on your response from an instructor who teaches
critical thinking or writing or to trade essays on
the same topic with other students and discuss one
another’s responses in relation to the scoring guide.
Try to determine how each essay meets or misses the
criteria for each score point in the guide. Comparing
your own response to the scoring guide will help you
see how and where to improve.
The Form of Your Response
You are free to organize and develop your response
in any way you think will enable you to effectively
communicate your ideas about the issue. Your response may incorporate particular writing strategies
learned in English composition or writing-intensive
college courses. GRE readers will not be looking for a
particular developmental strategy or mode of writing;
in fact, when GRE readers are trained, they review
hundreds of Issue responses that, although highly
diverse in content and form, display similar levels of
critical thinking and persuasive writing.
Readers will see some Issue responses at the 6
score level that begin by briefly summarizing the
writer’s position on the issue and then explicitly announcing the main points to be argued. They will see
others that lead into the writer’s position by making
a prediction, asking a series of questions, describing
a scenario or defining critical terms in the quotation. The readers know that a writer can earn a high
score by giving multiple examples or by presenting a
single, extended example. Look at the sample Issue
responses, particularly at the 5 and 6 score levels, to
see how other writers have successfully developed and
organized their arguments.
You should use as many or as few paragraphs as
you consider appropriate for your argument; e.g.,
you will probably need to create a new paragraph
whenever your discussion shifts to a new cluster of
ideas. What matters is not the number of examples,
the number of paragraphs or the form your argument
takes, but the cogency of your ideas about the issue

and the clarity and skill with which you communicate those ideas to academic readers.
Sample Issue Task
Following is a sample Issue task of the sort that you
might see on the test:
As people rely more and more on technology to
solve problems, the ability of humans to think for
themselves will surely deteriorate.
Discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree
with the statement and explain your reasoning
for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways
in which the statement might or might not hold
true and explain how these considerations shape
your position.
Strategies for This Topic
In this task, you are asked to discuss the extent to
which you agree or disagree with the statement.
Thus, responses may range from strong agreement or
strong disagreement to qualified agreement or qualified disagreement. You are also instructed to explain
your reasoning and consider ways in which the
statement might or might not hold true. A successful
response need not comment on all or any one of the
points listed below and may well discuss other reasons
or examples not mentioned here in support of the
position taken.
Although this topic is accessible to respondents
of all levels of ability, for your response to receive a
top score, it is particularly important that you remain
focused on the task and provide clearly relevant
examples and/or reasons to support the point of view
you are expressing. Lower level responses may be long
and full of examples of modern technology, but those
examples may not be clearly related to a particular
position. For example, a respondent who strongly
disagrees with the statement may choose to use
computer technology as proof that thinking ability
is not deteriorating. However, the mere existence of
computer technology does not adequately prove this
point; e.g., perhaps the ease of computer use inhibits
our thinking ability. To receive a higher level score,
the respondent should explain in what ways computer technology may call for or require thinking ability.
This topic could elicit a wide variety of approaches,
especially considering the different possible
interpretations of the phrase “the ability of humans

9

to think for themselves.” Although most respondents
may take it to mean problem solving, others could
interpret it as emotional and social intelligence; i.e.,
the ability to communicate/connect with others.
With any approach, it is possible to discuss examples
such as calculators, word processing tools such as
spell/grammar check, tax preparation software,
Internet research and a variety of other common
household and business technologies.
You may agree with the topic and argue that:
• reliance on technology leads to dependency; we
come to rely on problem-solving technologies
to such a degree that when they fail we are in
worse shape than if we didn’t have them
• everyday technologies such as calculators and
cash registers have decreased our ability to
perform simple calculations, a “use it or lose it”
approach to thinking ability
Or you may take issue with the topic and argue that
technology facilitates and improves our thinking
skills, arguing that:
• developing, implementing and using technology
requires problem solving
• technology frees us from mundane problem solving (e.g., calculations) and allows us to engage
in more complex thinking
• technology provides access to information otherwise unavailable
• technology connects people at a distance and
allows them to share ideas
• technology is dependent on the human ability
to think and make choices (every implementation of and advance in technology is driven by
human intelligence and decision making)
On the other hand, you could decide to explore the
middle ground in the debate and point out that while
technology may diminish some mental skill sets, it
enables other (perhaps more important) types of
thinking to thrive. Such a response might distinguish
between complex problem solving and simple “data
maintenance” (i.e., performing calculations and organizing information).
Other approaches could involve taking a historical, philosophical or sociological stance, or, with
equal effectiveness, using personal experience to
illustrate a position. One could argue that the value
or detriment of relying on technology is determined
by the individual (or society) using it or that only
those who develop technology (i.e., technical

10

specialists) are maintaining their problem-solving
skills, while the rest of us are losing them.
Again, it is important for you to avoid overly general examples or lists of examples without expansion.
It is also essential to do more than paraphrase the
prompt. Please keep in mind that what counts is the
ability to clearly express a particular point of view in
relation to the issue and specific task instructions and
to support that position with relevant reasons and/or
examples.
To view scored sample essay responses and reader
commentary for this sample topic, see Appendix B on
pages 99–107.

Analyze an Argument Task
The Analyze an Argument task assesses your ability
to understand, analyze and evaluate arguments
according to specific instructions and to convey your
evaluation clearly in your writing. The task consists
of a brief passage in which the author makes a case
for some course of action or interpretation of events
by presenting claims backed by reasons and evidence.
Your task is to discuss the logical soundness of the
author’s case by critically examining the line of reasoning and the use of evidence. This task requires you
to read the argument and instructions carefully. You
might want to read the argument more than once and
make brief notes about points you want to develop
more fully in your response. In reading the argument,
you should pay special attention to:
• what is offered as evidence, support or proof
• what is explicitly stated, claimed or concluded
• what is assumed or supposed, perhaps without
justification or proof
• what is not stated, but necessarily follows from
what is stated
In addition, you should consider the structure of the
argument—the way in which these elements are
linked together to form a line of reasoning; i.e., you
should recognize the separate, sometimes implicit
steps in the thinking process and consider whether
the movement from each step to the next is logically
sound. In tracing this line, look for transition words
and phrases that suggest the author is attempting to
make a logical connection (e.g., however, thus, therefore, evidently, hence, in conclusion).
An important part of performing well on the
Argument task is remembering what you are not
being asked to do:

• You are not being asked to discuss whether the
statements in the argument are true or accurate.
• You are not being asked to agree or disagree with
the position stated.
• You are not being asked to express your own
views on the subject being discussed (as you
were in the Issue task).
Instead, you are being asked to evaluate the logical soundness of an argument of another writer and,
in doing so, to demonstrate the critical thinking,
perceptive reading and analytical writing skills that
university faculty consider important for success in
graduate school.
It is important that you address the argument
according to the specific instructions. Each task is
accompanied by one of the following sets of instructions:
• Write a response in which you discuss what
specific evidence is needed to evaluate the
argument and explain how the evidence would
weaken or strengthen the argument.
• Write a response in which you examine the stated
and/or unstated assumptions of the argument.
Be sure to explain how the argument depends
on these assumptions, and what the implications
are for the argument if the assumptions prove
unwarranted.
• Write a response in which you discuss what
questions would need to be answered in
order to decide whether the recommendation
and the argument on which it is based are
reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers
to these questions would help to evaluate the
recommendation.
• Write a response in which you discuss what
questions would need to be answered in order to
decide whether the advice and the argument on
which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would
help to evaluate the advice.
• Write a response in which you discuss what
questions would need to be answered in order
to decide whether the recommendation is likely
to have the predicted result. Be sure to explain
how the answers to these questions would help
to evaluate the recommendation.
• Write a response in which you discuss what
questions would need to be answered in order to
decide whether the prediction and the argument
on which it is based are reasonable. Be sure

to explain how the answers to these questions
would help to evaluate the prediction.
• Write a response in which you discuss what
questions would need to be addressed in order to
decide whether the conclusion and the argument on which it is based are reasonable. Be
sure to explain how the answers to the questions
would help to evaluate the conclusion.
• Write a response in which you discuss one or
more alternative explanations that could rival
the proposed explanation and explain how your
explanation(s) can plausibly account for the
facts presented in the argument.
Analyze an Argument is a critical thinking task
requiring a written response. Consequently, the
analytical skills displayed in your evaluation carry
great weight in determining your score; however, the
clarity with which you convey ideas is also important
to your overall score.
Understanding the Context for Writing:
Purpose and Audience
The purpose of the task is to see how well equipped
you are to insightfully evaluate an argument written
by someone else and to effectively communicate your
evaluation in writing to an academic audience. Your
audience consists of GRE readers carefully trained
to apply the scoring criteria identified in the scoring
guide for the Analyze an Argument task on pages
96–97.
To get a clearer idea of how GRE readers apply the
Argument scoring criteria to actual essays, you should
review scored sample Argument essay responses and
reader commentary. The sample responses, particularly at the 5 and 6 score levels, will show you a
variety of successful strategies for organizing and
developing an insightful evaluation. The reader
commentary discusses specific aspects of analytical
writing, such as cogency of ideas, development and
support, organization, syntactic variety and facility
with language. For each response, the commentary
points out aspects that are particularly effective and
insightful as well as any that detract from the overall
effectiveness of the essay.
Preparing for the Argument Task
Since the Argument task is meant to assess analytical
writing and informal reasoning skills that you have
developed throughout your education, it has been
designed neither to require any specific course of

11

study nor to advantage students with a particular type
of training.
Many college textbooks on rhetoric and composition have sections on informal logic and critical
thinking that might prove helpful, but even these
might be more detailed and technical than the task
requires. You will not be expected to know specific
methods of analysis or technical terms.
For instance, in one topic an elementary school
principal might conclude that new playground equipment has improved student attendance because
absentee rates have declined since it was installed.
You will not need to see that the principal has committed the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy; you will
simply need to see that there are other possible explanations for the improved attendance, to offer some
common-sense examples and to suggest what would
be necessary to verify the conclusion. For instance,
absentee rates might have decreased because the
climate was mild. This would have to be ruled out in
order for the principal’s conclusion to be valid.
Although you do not need to know special analytical techniques and terminology, you should be
familiar with the directions for the Argument task and
with certain key concepts, including the following:
• alternative explanation—a competing version
of what might have caused the events in question that undercuts or qualifies the original
explanation because it, too, can account for the
observed facts
• analysis—the process of breaking something
(e.g., an argument) down into its component
parts in order to understand how they work
together to make up the whole
• argument—a claim or a set of claims with
reasons and evidence offered as support; a line
of reasoning meant to demonstrate the truth or
falsehood of something
• assumption—a belief, often unstated or unexamined, that someone must hold in order to
maintain a particular position; something that is
taken for granted but that must be true in order
for the conclusion to be true
• conclusion—the end point reached by a line of
reasoning, valid if the reasoning is sound; the
resulting assertion
• counterexample—an example, real or hypothetical, that refutes or disproves a statement in the
argument

12

• evaluation—an assessment of the quality of
evidence and reasons in an argument and of the
overall merit of an argument
An excellent way to prepare for the Analyze an
Argument task is to practice writing on some of the
published Argument topics. There is no one way to
practice that is best for everyone. Some prefer to start
practicing without adhering to the 30-minute time
limit. If you follow this approach, take all the time
you need to evaluate the argument. Regardless of the
approach you take, consider the following steps:
• Carefully read the argument and the specific
instructions—you might want to read them
more than once.
• Identify as many of the argument’s claims, conclusions and underlying assumptions as possible
and evaluate their quality.
• Think of as many alternative explanations and
counterexamples as you can.
• Think of what specific additional evidence
might weaken or lend support to the claims.
• Ask yourself what changes in the argument
would make the reasoning more sound.
Write down each of these thoughts. When you’ve
gone as far as you can with your evaluation, look over
the notes and put them in a good order for discussion (perhaps by numbering them). Then write an
evaluation according to the specific instructions by
fully developing each point that is relevant to those
instructions. Even if you choose not to write a full
essay response, you should find it helpful to practice
evaluating a few of the arguments and sketching out
your responses.
When you become quicker and more confident,
you should practice writing some Argument responses
within the 30-minute time limit so that you will have
a good sense of how to pace yourself in the actual
test. For example, you will not want to discuss one
point so exhaustively or to provide so many equivalent examples that you run out of time to make your
other main points.
You might want to get feedback on your
response(s) from a writing instructor, philosophy
teacher or someone who emphasizes critical thinking in his or her course. It can also be informative
to trade papers on the same topic with fellow students and discuss each other’s responses in terms of
the scoring guide. Focus not so much on the “right
scores” as on seeing how the responses meet or miss

the performance standards for each score point and
what you need to do to improve.
How to Interpret Numbers, Percentages and
Statistics in Argument Topics
Some arguments contain numbers, percentages or
statistics that are offered as evidence in support of
the argument’s conclusion. For example, an argument
might claim that a certain community event is less
popular this year than it was last year because only
100 people attended this year in comparison with 150
last year, a 33 percent decline in attendance.
It is important to remember that you are not being
asked to do a mathematical task with the numbers,
percentages or statistics. Instead you should evaluate
these as evidence intended to support the conclusion.
In the example above, the conclusion is that a community event has become less popular. You should
ask yourself, “Does the difference between 100 people
and 150 people support that conclusion?” In this
case, there are other possible explanations; e.g., the
weather might have been much worse this year, this
year’s event might have been held at an inconvenient
time, the cost of the event might have gone up this
year or there might have been another popular event
this year at the same time.
Any one of these could explain the difference
in attendance and weaken the conclusion that the
event was “less popular.” Similarly, percentages might
support or weaken a conclusion depending on what
actual numbers the percentages represent. Consider
the claim that the drama club at a school deserves
more funding because its membership has increased
by 100 percent. This 100 percent increase could be
significant if there had been 100 members and now
there are 200 members, whereas the increase would
be much less significant if there had been five members and now there are 10.
Remember that any numbers, percentages or statistics in Argument tasks are used only as evidence in
support of a conclusion, and you should always consider whether they actually support the conclusion.

The Form of Your Response
You are free to organize and develop your response
in any way you think will effectively communicate
your evaluation of the argument. Your response may,
but need not, incorporate particular writing strategies
learned in English composition or writing-intensive
college courses. GRE readers will not be looking for a
particular developmental strategy or mode of writing.
In fact, when GRE readers are trained, they review
hundreds of Argument responses that, although
highly diverse in content and form, display similar
levels of critical thinking and analytical writing.
For example, readers will see some essays at the
6 score level that begin by briefly summarizing the
argument and then explicitly stating and developing
the main points of the evaluation. The readers know
that a writer can earn a high score by developing
several points in an evaluation or by identifying a
central feature in the argument and developing that
evaluation extensively. You might want to look at the
sample Argument responses, particularly at the 5 and
6 score levels, to see how other writers have successfully developed and organized their responses.
You should make choices about format and organization that you think support and enhance the overall effectiveness of your evaluation. This means using
as many or as few paragraphs as you consider appropriate for your response; e.g., create a new paragraph
when your discussion shifts to a new point of evaluation. You might want to organize your evaluation
around the structure of the argument itself, discussing
it line by line. Or you might want to first point out a
central questionable assumption and then move on
to discuss related weaknesses in the argument’s line of
reasoning.
Similarly, you might want to use examples to help
illustrate an important point in your evaluation or
move your discussion forward. However, remember
that it is your critical thinking and analytical writing
that are being assessed, not your ability to come up
with examples. What matters is not the form your
response takes, but how insightfully you evaluate the
argument and how articulately you communicate
your evaluation to academic readers within the context of the task.

Sample Argument Task
Following is a sample Argument task that you might
see on the test:
In surveys Mason City residents rank water sports
(swimming, boating and fishing) among their
favorite recreational activities. The Mason River
flowing through the city is rarely used for these
pursuits, however, and the city park department
devotes little of its budget to maintaining riverside
recreational facilities. For years there have been
complaints from residents about the quality of the
river’s water and the river’s smell. In response, the
state has recently announced plans to clean up
Mason River. Use of the river for water sports is
therefore sure to increase. The city government
should for that reason devote more money in this
year’s budget to riverside recreational facilities.
Write a response in which you examine the
stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument.
Be sure to explain how the argument depends on
these assumptions and what the implications are
if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

Strategies for This Topic
This argument cites a survey to support the prediction that the use of the Mason River is sure to
increase and thus recommends that the city government should devote more money in this year’s budget
to the riverside recreational facilities.
In developing your evaluation, you are asked
to examine the argument’s stated and/or unstated
assumptions and discuss what the implications are
if the assumptions prove unwarranted. A successful
response must discuss both the argument’s assumptions AND the implications of these assumptions for
the argument. A response that does not address both
parts of the task is unlikely to receive an upper-half
score.
Though responses may well raise other points,
some assumptions of the argument, and some ways in
which the argument depends on those assumptions,
include:
• The assumption that people who rank water
sports “among their favorite recreational activities” are actually likely to participate in them.
(It is possible that they just like to watch them.)
This assumption underlies the claim that use
of the river for water sports is sure to increase

14

•

•

after the state cleans up the Mason River and
that the city should for that reason devote more
money to riverside recreational facilities.
The assumption that what residents say in
surveys can be taken at face value. (It is possible that survey results exaggerate the interest
in water sports.) This assumption underlies the
claim that use of the river for water sports is sure
to increase after the state cleans up the Mason
River and that the city should for that reason
devote more money to riverside recreational
facilities.
The assumption that Mason City residents
would actually want to do water sports in the
Mason River. (As recreational activities, it is
possible that water sports are regarded as pursuits
for vacations and weekends away from the city.)
This assumption underlies the claim that use
of the river for water sports is sure to increase
after the state cleans up the Mason River and
that the city should for that reason devote more
money to riverside recreational facilities.
The assumption that the park department’s
devoting little of its budget to maintaining
riverside recreational facilities means that these
facilities are inadequately maintained. This
assumption underlies the claim that the city
should devote more money in this year’s budget to riverside recreational facilities. If current facilities are adequately maintained, then
increased funding might not be needed even if
recreational use of the river does increase.
The assumption that the riverside recreational
facilities are facilities designed for people who
participate in water sports and not some other
recreational pursuit. This assumption underlies the claim that the city should devote more
money in this year’s budget to riverside recreational facilities.
The assumption that the dirtiness of the river is
the cause of its being little used and that cleaning up the river will be sufficient to increase
recreational use of the river. (Residents might
have complained about the water quality and
smell even if they had no desire to boat, swim or
fish in the river.) This assumption underlies the
claim that the state’s plan to clean up the river
will result in increased use of the river for water
sports.

• The assumption that the complaints about the
river are numerous and significant. This assumption motivates the state’s plan to clean up the
river and underlies the claim that use of the
river for water sports is sure to increase. (Perhaps
the complaints are coming from a very small
minority, in which case cleaning the river might
be a misuse of state funds.)
• The assumption that the state’s clean-up will
occur soon enough to require adjustments to
this year’s budget. This assumption underlies the
claim that the city should devote more money
in this year’s budget to riverside recreational
facilities.
• The assumption that the clean-up, when it happens, will benefit those parts of the river accessible from the city’s facilities. This assumption
underlies the claim that the city should devote
more money to riverside recreational facilities.
• The assumption that the city government ought
to devote more attention to maintaining a
recreational facility if demand for that facility
increases.
• The assumption that the city should finance the
new project and not some other agency or group
(public or private).
Should any of the above assumptions prove unwarranted, the implications are:
• that the logic of the argument falls apart/is
invalid/is unsound
• that the state and city are spending their funds
unnecessarily

Introduction to the Verbal
Reasoning Measure
The Verbal Reasoning measure assesses your ability to
analyze and evaluate written material and synthesize
information obtained from it, analyze relationships
among component parts of sentences and recognize
relationships among words and concepts.
Verbal Reasoning questions appear in several
formats, each of which is discussed in detail below.
About half of the measure requires you to read passages and answer questions on those passages.

The other half requires you to read, interpret and
complete existing sentences, groups of sentences or
paragraphs.

Verbal Reasoning Question Types
The Verbal Reasoning measure contains three types
of questions:
• Reading Comprehension questions
• Text Completion questions
• Sentence Equivalence questions

Reading Comprehension Questions
Reading Comprehension questions are designed to
test a wide range of abilities that are required in order
to read and understand the kinds of prose commonly
encountered in graduate school. Those abilities include:
• understanding the meaning of individual words
and sentences
• understanding the meaning of paragraphs and
larger bodies of text
• distinguishing between minor and major points
• summarizing a passage
• drawing conclusions from the information
provided
• reasoning from incomplete data to infer missing
information
• understanding the structure of a text in terms of
how the parts relate to one another
• identifying the author’s assumptions and
perspective
• analyzing a text and reaching conclusions about it
• identifying strengths and weaknesses of a
position
• developing and considering alternative
explanations
As this list implies, reading and understanding a piece
of text requires far more than a passive understanding
of the words and sentences it contains; it requires
active engagement with the text, asking questions,
formulating and evaluating hypotheses and reflecting
on the relationship of the particular text to other
texts and information.
Each Reading Comprehension question is based
on a passage that may range in length from one paragraph to several paragraphs. The test contains 12 to
15 passages, the majority of which are one paragraph
in length and only one or two of which are several

15

paragraphs long. Passages are drawn from the physical
sciences, biological sciences, social sciences, arts and
humanities and everyday topics and are based on
material found in books and periodicals, both
academic and nonacademic.
Typically, about half of the questions on the test
will be based on passages, and the number of questions based on a given passage can range from one
to six. Questions can cover any of the topics listed
above, from the meaning of a particular word to
assessing evidence that might support or weaken
points made in the passage. Many, but not all, of the
questions are standard multiple-choice questions,
in which you are required to select a single answer
choice, and others ask you to select multiple answer
choices.
General Advice
• Reading passages are drawn from many different
disciplines and sources, so you may encounter
material with which you are not familiar. Do not
be discouraged if you encounter unfamiliar
material; all the questions can be answered on
the basis of the information provided in the
passage. However, if you encounter a passage
that seems particularly hard or unfamiliar, you
may want to save it for last.
• Read and analyze the passage carefully before
trying to answer any of the questions, and pay
attention to clues that help you understand less
explicit aspects of the passage.
0 Try to distinguish main ideas from supporting
ideas or evidence.
0 Try to distinguish ideas that the author is
advancing from those he or she is merely
reporting.
0 Try to distinguish ideas that the author is
strongly committed to from those he or she
advances as hypothetical or speculative.
0 Try to identify the main transitions from one
idea to the next.
0 Try to identify the relationship between different ideas. For example:
▪ Are they contrasting? Are they consistent?
▪ Does one support the other?
▪ Does one spell the other out in greater
detail?
▪ Does one apply the other to a particular
circumstance?

16

• Read each question carefully and be certain that
you understand exactly what is being asked.
• Answer each question on the basis of the information provided in the passage and do not rely
on outside knowledge. Sometimes your own
views or opinions may conflict with those presented in a passage; if this happens, take special
care to work within the context provided by the
passage. You should not expect to agree with
everything you encounter in the reading
passages.
Reading Comprehension Multiple-choice
Questions—Select One Answer Choice
These questions are standard multiple-choice questions with five answer choices, of which you must
select one.
Tips for Answering
• Read all the answer choices before making your
selection, even if you think you know the correct answer in advance.
• The correct answer choice is the one that most
accurately and most completely answers the
question posed; be careful not to be misled
by choices that are only partially true or only
partially answer the question. Also, be careful
not to pick a choice simply because it is a true
statement.
• When the question asks about the meaning of a
word in the passage, be sure the answer choice
you select correctly represents the way the word
is being used in the passage. Many words have
different meanings when used in different
contexts.
Reading Comprehension Multiple-choice
Questions—Select One or More Answer Choices
These questions provide three answer choices and ask
you to select all that are correct; one, two or all three
of the answer choices may be correct. To gain credit
for these questions, you must select all the correct
choices, and only those; there is no credit for partially
correct answers.

Tips for Answering
• Evaluate each answer choice separately on its
own merits; when evaluating one choice, do not
take the others into account.
• A correct answer choice accurately and completely answers the question posed; be careful
not to be misled by choices that are only partially true or only partially answer the question.
Also, be careful not to pick a choice simply
because it is a true statement.
• Do not be disturbed if you think all three answer
choices are correct, since questions of this type
can have up to three correct answer choices.
Important Note: In some test preparation materials,
you may see references to a third type of Reading
Comprehension question, “Select in Passage.”
Because these questions depend on the use of the
computer, they do not appear on the paper-based test.
Similar multiple-choice questions are used in their
place.
Sample Questions
Questions 1 and 2 are based on this passage
Reviving the practice of using elements of popular music in classical composition, an approach
that had been in hibernation in the United
States during the 1960s, composer Philip Glass
(born 1937) embraced the ethos of popular music
in his compositions. Glass based two symphonies
on music by rock musicians David Bowie and
Brian Eno, but the symphonies’ sound is distinctively his. Popular elements do not appear out
of place in Glass’s classical music, which from
its early days has shared certain harmonies and
rhythms with rock music. Yet this use of popular
elements has not made Glass a composer of popular music. His music is not a version of popular
music packaged to attract classical listeners; it is
high art for listeners steeped in rock rather than
the classics.

Directions: Select only one answer choice.
1.

The passage addresses which of the following
issues related to Glass’s use of popular elements
in his classical compositions?
a
b
c

d

e

How it is regarded by listeners who prefer
rock to the classics
How it has affected the commercial success
of Glass’s music
Whether it has contributed to a revival of
interest among other composers in using
popular elements in their compositions
Whether it has had a detrimental effect on
Glass’s reputation as a composer of classical
music
Whether it has caused certain of Glass’s
works to be derivative in quality

Directions: Consider each of the choices
separately and select all that apply.
2.

The passage suggests that Glass’s work displays
which of the following qualities?
a
b

c

A return to the use of popular music in
classical compositions
An attempt to elevate rock music to an
artistic status more closely approximating
that of classical music
A long-standing tendency to incorporate
elements from two apparently disparate
musical styles

Explanation
The passage describes in general terms how Philip
Glass uses popular music in his classical compositions
and explores how Glass can do this without being
imitative. Note that there are no opposing views
discussed; the author is simply presenting his or her
views.
Question 1: One of the important points that the
passage makes is that when Glass uses popular elements in his music, the result is very much his own
creation (it is “distinctively his”). In other words, the
music is far from being derivative. Thus one issue that
the passage addresses is the one referred to in answer
Choice E—it answers it in the negative. The passage
does not discuss the impact of Glass’s use of popular
elements on listeners, on the commercial success of
his music, on other composers or on Glass’s reputation, so none of Choices A through D is correct.
The correct answer is Choice E.

17

Question 2: To answer this question, it is important
to assess each answer choice independently. Since
the passage says that Glass revived the use of popular
music in classical compositions, answer Choice A is
clearly correct. On the other hand, the passage also
denies that Glass composes popular music or packages
it in a way to elevate its status, so answer Choice B is
incorrect. Finally, since Glass’s style has always mixed
elements of rock with classical elements, answer
Choice C is correct.
Thus the correct answer is Choice A and Choice C.

Text Completion Questions
As mentioned earlier, skilled readers do not simply
absorb the information presented on the page;
instead, they maintain a constant attitude of interpretation and evaluation, reasoning from what they
have read so far to create a picture of the whole and
revising that picture as they go. Text Completion
questions test this ability by omitting crucial words
from short passages and asking the test taker to use
the remaining information in the passage as a basis
for selecting words or short phrases to fill the blanks
and create a coherent, meaningful whole.
Question Structure
• Passage composed of one to five sentences
• One to three blanks
• Three answer choices per blank (five answer
choices in the case of a single blank)
• The answer choices for different blanks function independently; i.e., selecting one choice for
one blank does not affect what choices you can
select for another blank
• Single correct answer, consisting of one choice
for each blank; no credit for partially correct
answers

18

Tips for Answering
Do not merely try to consider each possible combination of answers; doing so will take too long and is
open to error. Instead, try to analyze the passage in
the following way:
• Read through the passage to get an overall sense
of it.
• Identify words or phrases that seem particularly
significant, either because they emphasize the
structure of the passage (words like although or
moreover) or because they are central to understanding what the passage is about.
• Try to fill in the blanks with words or phrases
that seem to complete the sentence, then see
if similar words are offered among the answer
choices.
• Do not assume that the first blank is the one
that should be filled first; perhaps one of the
other blanks is easier to fill first. Select your
choice for that blank, and then see whether
you can complete another blank. If none of the
choices for the other blank seem to make sense,
go back and reconsider your first selection.
• When you have made your selection for each
blank, check to make sure the passage is logically, grammatically and stylistically coherent.

Sample Questions
Directions: For each blank, select one entry from the corresponding column of choices. Fill all blanks in
the way that best completes the text.
1.

It is refreshing to read a book about our planet by an author who does not allow facts to be (i)__________
by politics: well aware of the political disputes about the effects of human activities on climate and biodiversity, this author does not permit them to (ii)__________ his comprehensive description of what
we know about our biosphere. He emphasizes the enormous gaps in our knowledge, the sparseness of our
observations, and the (iii)__________, calling attention to the many aspects of planetary evolution that
must be better understood before we can accurately diagnose the condition of our planet.
Blank (i)
a overshadowed
b invalidated
c illuminated

Blank (ii)
d enhance
e obscure
f underscore

Blank (iii)
g plausibility of our hypotheses
h certainty of our entitlement
i superficiality of our theories

Explanation
The overall tone of the passage is clearly complimentary. To understand what the author of the book is being
complimented on, it is useful to focus on the second blank. Here, we must determine what word would indicate
something that the author is praised for not permitting. The only answer choice that fits the case is “obscure,”
since enhancing and underscoring are generally good things to do, not things one should refrain from doing.
Choosing “obscure” clarifies the choice for the first blank; the only choice that fits well with “obscure” is “overshadowed.” Notice that trying to fill blank (i) without filling blank (ii) first is hard—each choice has at least
some initial plausibility. Since the third blank requires a phrase that matches “enormous gaps” and “sparseness
of our observations,” the best choice is “superficiality of our theories.”
Thus the correct answer is Choice A (overshadowed), Choice E (obscure) and Choice I (superficiality of
our theories).
2.

Vain and prone to violence, Caravaggio could not handle success: the more his (i)__________ as an artist
increased, the more (ii)__________ his life became.
Blank (i)
a temperance
b notoriety
c eminence

Blank (ii)
d tumultuous
e providential
f dispassionate

Explanation
In this sentence, what follows the colon must explain or spell out what precedes it. So, roughly, what the second
part must say is that as Caravaggio became more successful, his life got more out of control. When one looks
for words to fill the blanks, it becomes clear that “tumultuous” is the best fit for blank (ii), since neither of the
other choices suggests being out of control. And for blank (i), the best choice is “eminence,” since to increase
in eminence is a consequence of becoming more successful. It is true that Caravaggio might also increase in
notoriety, but an increase in notoriety as an artist is not as clear a sign of success as an increase in eminence.
Thus the correct answer is Choice C (eminence) and Choice D (tumultuous).

19

3.

In parts of the Arctic, the land grades into the
landfast ice so _______ that you can walk off
the coast and not know you are over the hidden
sea.
a
b
c
d
e

• Read the sentence to get an overall sense of it.
• Identify words or phrases that seem particularly
significant, either because they emphasize the
structure of the sentence (words like although or
moreover) or because they are central to understanding what the sentence is about.
• Try to fill in the blank with a word that seems
appropriate to you and then see if two similar
words are offered among the answer choices. If
you find some word that is similar to what you
are expecting but cannot find a second one, do
not become fixated on your interpretation; instead, see whether there are other words among
the choices that can be used to fill the blank
coherently.
• When you have selected your pair of answer
choices, check to make sure that each one
produces a sentence that is logically, grammatically and stylistically coherent, and that the two
sentences mean the same thing.

permanently
imperceptibly
irregularly
precariously
relentlessly

Explanation
The word that fills the blank has to characterize how
the land grades into the ice in a way that explains
how you can walk off the coast and over the sea without knowing it. The word that does that is “imperceptibly;” if the land grades imperceptibly into the ice,
you might well not know that you had left the land.
Describing the shift from land to ice as permanent,
irregular, precarious or relentless would not help to
explain how you would fail to know.
Thus the correct answer is Choice B
(imperceptibly).

Sentence Equivalence Questions
Like Text Completion questions, Sentence Equivalence questions test the ability to reach a conclusion
about how a passage should be completed on the
basis of partial information, but to a greater extent
they focus on the meaning of the completed whole.
Sentence Equivalence questions consist of a single
sentence with just one blank, and they ask you to find
two answer choices that lead to a complete, coherent
sentence while producing sentences that mean the
same thing.

• Consists of a single sentence, one blank, and six
answer choices.
• Requires you to select two of the answer choices;
no credit for partially correct answers.
Tips for Answering
Do not simply look among the answer choices for two
words that mean the same thing. This can be misleading for two reasons. First, the choices may contain
pairs of words that mean the same thing but do not
fit coherently into the sentence. Second, the pair of
words that do constitute the correct answer may not
mean exactly the same thing, since all that matters is
that the resultant sentences mean the same thing.

Although it does contain some pioneering
ideas, one would hardly characterize the work as
__________.
a
b
c
d
e
f

orthodox
eccentric
original
trifling
conventional
innovative

Explanation
The word “Although” is a crucial signpost here. The
work contains some pioneering ideas, but apparently it is not overall a pioneering work. Thus the
two words that could fill the blank appropriately are
“original” and “innovative.” Note that “orthodox”
and “conventional” are two words that are very
similar in meaning, but neither one completes the
sentence sensibly.
Thus the correct answer is Choice C (original) and
Choice F (innovative).

Introduction to the
Quantitative Reasoning
Measure
The Quantitative Reasoning measure assesses your:
• basic mathematical skills
• understanding of elementary mathematical
concepts
• ability to reason quantitatively and to model
and solve problems with quantitative methods
Some of the questions in the measure are posed in
real-life settings, while others are posed in purely
mathematical settings. The skills, concepts, and abilities are tested in the four content areas below.
• Arithmetic topics include properties and types
of integers, such as divisibility, factorization,
prime numbers, remainders, and odd and even
integers; arithmetic operations, exponents, and
roots; and concepts such as estimation, percent,
ratio, rate, absolute value, the number line, decimal representation and sequences of numbers.
• Algebra topics include operations with exponents; factoring and simplifying algebraic
expressions; relations, functions, equations and
inequalities; solving linear and quadratic equations and inequalities; solving simultaneous
equations and inequalities; setting up equations
to solve word problems; and coordinate geometry, including graphs of functions, equations,
and inequalities, intercepts, and slopes of lines.
• Geometry topics include parallel and perpendicular lines, circles, triangles—including isosceles,
equilateral, and 30°-60°-90° triangles—quadrilaterals, other polygons, congruent and similar
figures, three-dimensional figures, area, perimeter, volume, the Pythagorean theorem and
angle measurement in degrees. The ability to
construct proofs is not tested.
• Data analysis topics include basic descriptive
statistics, such as mean, median, mode, range,
standard deviation, interquartile range, quartiles, and percentiles; interpretation of data
in tables and graphs, such as line graphs, bar
graphs, circle graphs, boxplots, scatterplots and
frequency distributions; elementary probability,
such as probabilities of compound events and

independent events; random variables and probability distributions, including normal distributions; and counting methods, such as combinations, permutations, and Venn diagrams. These
topics are typically taught in high school algebra
courses or introductory statistics courses. Inferential statistics is not tested.
The content in these areas includes high school
mathematics and statistics at a level that is generally
no higher than a second course in algebra; it does not
include trigonometry, calculus, or other higher-level
mathematics. The publication Math Review, which
is available at www.ets.org/gre/prepare, provides
detailed information about the content of the Quantitative Reasoning measure.
The mathematical symbols, terminology, and conventions used in the Quantitative Reasoning measure
are those that are standard at the high school level.
For example, the positive direction of a number line
is to the right, distances are nonnegative, and prime
numbers are greater than 1. Whenever nonstandard
notation is used in a question, it is explicitly introduced in the question.
In addition to conventions, there are some assumptions about numbers and geometric figures that
are used in the Quantitative Reasoning measure. Two
of these assumptions are (1) all numbers used are real
numbers and (2) geometric figures are not necessarily
drawn to scale. More about conventions and assumptions appears in the publication Mathematical Conventions, which is available at www.ets.org/gre/prepare.

Quantitative Reasoning Question
Types
The Quantitative Reasoning measure has four types
of questions:
• Quantitative Comparison questions
• Multiple-choice questions—Select One Answer
Choice
• Multiple-choice questions—Select One or More
Answer Choices
• Numeric Entry questions
Each question appears either independently as a discrete question or as part of a set of questions called a
Data Interpretation set. All of the questions in a Data
Interpretation set are based on the same data presented
in tables, graphs, or other displays of data.

21

For the paper-based test, you are allowed to use a
basic handheld calculator on the Quantitative Reasoning measure. The calculator will be provided to
you at the test site, and you may keep it when you are
finished with the test. Information about using the
calculator to help you answer questions appears later.

Quantitative Comparison Questions
Questions of this type ask you to compare two quantities—Quantity A and Quantity B—and then determine which of the following statements describes the
comparison.
a
b
c
d

Quantity A is greater.
Quantity B is greater.
The two quantities are equal.
The relationship cannot be determined
from the information given.

Tips for Answering
• Become familiar with the answer choices.
Quantitative Comparison questions always have
the same answer choices, so get to know them,
especially the last choice, “The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.”
Never select this last choice if it is clear that the
values of the two quantities can be determined
by computation. Also, if you determine that one
quantity is greater than the other, make sure you
carefully select the corresponding choice so as
not to reverse the first two choices.
• Avoid unnecessary computations. Don’t waste
time performing needless computations in order
to compare the two quantities. Simplify, transform, or estimate one or both of the given quantities only as much as is necessary to compare
them.
• Remember that geometric figures are not necessarily drawn to scale. If any aspect of a given
geometric figure is not fully determined, try to
redraw the figure, keeping those aspects that are
completely determined by the given information
fixed but changing the aspects of the figure that
are not determined. Examine the results. What
variations are possible in the relative lengths of
line segments or measures of angles?

22

• Plug in numbers. If one or both of the quantities are algebraic expressions, you can substitute
easy numbers for the variables and compare the
resulting quantities in your analysis. Consider
all kinds of appropriate numbers before you
give an answer: e.g., zero, positive and negative
numbers, small and large numbers, fractions, and
decimals. If you see that Quantity A is greater
than Quantity B in one case and Quantity B is
greater than Quantity A in another case, choose
“The relationship cannot be determined from
the information given.”
• Simplify the comparison. If both quantities
are algebraic or arithmetic expressions and you
cannot easily see a relationship between them,
you can try to simplify the comparison. Try a
step-by-step simplification that is similar to the
steps involved when you solve the equation
5 = 4 x + 3 for x, or similar to the steps involved
when you determine that the inequality

3y + 2
< y is equivalent to the simpler in5
equality 1 < y. Begin by setting up a comparison
involving the two quantities, as follows:
Quantity A ? Quantity B
where ? is a “placeholder” that could represent
the relationship greater than (>), less than (<),
or equal to (=) or could represent the fact that
the relationship cannot be determined from
the information given. Then try to simplify the
comparison, step by step, until you can determine a relationship between simplified quantities. For example, you may conclude after the
last step that ? represents equal to (=). Based
on this conclusion, you may be able to compare
Quantities A and B. To understand this strategy
more fully, see sample question 3.

Sample Questions
Directions: Compare Quantity A and Quantity B, using additional information centered above the two
quantities if such information is given. Select one of the following four answer choices and fill in the corresponding circle to the right of the question.

Explanation
From Figure 1, you know that PQR is a triangle and that point S is between points P and R, so PS  PR and
SR  PR. You are also given that PQ = PR. However, this information is not sufficient to compare PS and SR.
Furthermore, because the figure is not necessarily drawn to scale, you cannot determine the relative sizes of PS
and SR visually from the figure, though they may appear to be equal. The position of S can vary along side PR
anywhere between P and R. Below are two possible variations of Figure 1, each of which is drawn to be consistent with the information PQ  PR.

Note that Quantity A is greater in Figure 2 and Quantity B is greater in Figure 3.
Thus, the correct answer is Choice D, the relationship cannot be determined from the information given.

If x  0, then y  2 02  7 0   3  3, so in this case, x > y ; but if x  1, then y  2 12  7 1  3  6, so
in that case, y > x.

Thus, the correct answer is Choice D, the relationship cannot be determined from the information given.
Note that plugging numbers into expressions may not be conclusive. However, it is conclusive if you get different
results after plugging in different numbers: the conclusion is that the relationship cannot be determined from
the information given. It is also conclusive if there are only a small number of possible numbers to plug in and
all of them yield the same result, say, that Quantity B is greater.
Now suppose there are an infinite number of possible numbers to plug in. If you plug many of them in and
each time the result is, for example, that Quantity A is greater, you still cannot conclude that Quantity A is
greater for every possible number that could be plugged in. Further analysis would be necessary and should focus
on whether Quantity A is greater for all possible numbers or whether there are numbers for which Quantity A is
not greater.

Set up the initial comparison:

3y + 2

5y

Step 2: Subtract 3y from both sides to get

2

?

2y

Step 3: Divide both sides by 2 to get

1 ?

Then simplify:
Step 1: Multiply both sides by 5 to get

y

The comparison is now simplified as much as possible. In order to compare 1 and y, note that you are given
the information y  4 (above Quantities A and B). It follows from y  4 that y  1, or 1  y, so that in the
comparison 1 ? y, the placeholder ? represents less than (<): 1  y .
However, the problem asks for a comparison between Quantity A and Quantity B, not a comparison between
1 and y. To go from the comparison between 1 and y to a comparison between Quantities A and B, start with the
last comparison, 1  y, and carefully consider each simplification step in reverse order to determine what each
comparison implies about the preceding comparison, all the way back to the comparison between Quantities
A and B if possible. Since step 3 was “divide both sides by 2,” multiplying both sides of the comparison 1  y by
2 implies the preceding comparison 2  2 y, thus reversing step 3. Each simplification step can be reversed as
follows:
• Reverse step 3: multiply both sides by 2.
• Reverse step 2: add 3y to both sides.
• Reverse step 1: divide both sides by 5.

24

When each step is reversed, the relationship remains
less than (<), so Quantity A is less than Quantity B.
Thus, the correct answer is Choice B, Quantity B
is greater.
While some simplification steps like subtracting
3 from both sides or dividing both sides by 10 are
always reversible, it is important to note that some
steps, like squaring both sides, may not be reversible.
Also, note that when you simplify an inequality,
the steps of multiplying or dividing both sides by a
negative number change the direction of the inequality; for example, if x  y, then  x   y. So the
relationship in the final, simplified inequality may be
the opposite of the relationship between Quantities A
and B. This is another reason to consider the impact
of each step carefully.
The strategy of simplifying the comparison works
most efficiently when you note that a simplification
step is reversible while actually taking the step. Here
are some common steps that are always reversible:
• Adding any number or expression to both sides
of a comparison
• Subtracting any number or expression from both
sides
• Multiplying both sides by any nonzero number
or expression
• Dividing both sides by any nonzero number or
expression
Remember that if the relationship is an inequality,
multiplying or dividing both sides by any negative
number or expression will yield the opposite inequality. Be aware that some common operations like squaring both sides are generally not reversible and may
require further analysis using other information given
in the question in order to justify reversing such steps.

Multiple-choice Questions—Select
One Answer Choice
These questions are multiple-choice questions that
ask you to select only one answer choice from a list of
five choices.
Tips for Answering
• Use the fact that the answer is there. If your
answer is not one of the five answer choices
given, you should assume that your answer is
incorrect and do the following:
0 Reread the question carefully—you may have
missed an important detail or misinterpreted
some information.
0 Check your computations—you may have
made a mistake, such as mis-keying a number
on the calculator.
0 Reevaluate your solution method—you may
have a flaw in your reasoning.
• Examine the answer choices. In some questions
you are asked explicitly which of the choices
has a certain property. You may have to consider
each choice separately or you may be able to
see a relationship between the choices that will
help you find the answer more quickly. In other
questions, it may be helpful to work backward
from the choices, say, by substituting the choices
in an equation or inequality to see which one
works. However, be careful, as that method may
take more time than using reasoning.
• For questions that require approximations,
scan the answer choices to see how close an
approximation is needed. In other questions,
too, it may be helpful to scan the choices briefly
before solving the problem to get a better sense
of what the question is asking. If computations
are involved in the solution, it may be necessary to carry out all computations exactly and
round only your final answer in order to get the
required degree of accuracy. In other questions,
you may find that estimation is sufficient and
will help you avoid spending time on long computations.

Explanation
You can see that all five answer choices are linear
functions whose graphs are lines with various slopes
and y-intercepts. The graph of Choice A is a line with
slope 1 and y-intercept −2, shown in Figure 5.

1

x

It is clear that this line will not intersect the graph of
f to the left of the y-axis. To the right of the y-axis,
the graph of f is a line with slope 2, which is greater
than slope 1. Consequently, as the value of x increases,
the value of y increases faster for f than for g, and
therefore the graphs do not intersect to the right of
the y-axis. Choice B is similarly ruled out. Note that
if the y-intercept of either of the lines in Choices A
and B were greater than or equal to 4 instead of less
than 4, they would intersect the graph of f.
Choices C and D are lines with slope 2 and yintercepts less than 4. Hence, they are parallel to the
graph of f (to the right of the y-axis) and therefore
will not intersect it. Any line with a slope greater
than 2 and a y-intercept less than 4, like the line in
Choice E, will intersect the graph of f (to the right of
the y-axis).
The correct answer is Choice E, g  x   3 x  2.

Each employee of a certain company is in either
Department X or Department Y, and there
are more than twice as many employees in

27

Explanation
One strategy for answering this kind of question is to
find the least and/or greatest possible value. Clearly
the average salary is between $25,000 and $35,000,
and all of the answer choices are in this interval.
Since you are told that there are more employees
with the lower average salary, the average salary of all
employees must be less than the average of $25,000
and $35,000, which is $30,000. If there were exactly
twice as many employees in Department X as in
Department Y, then the average salary for all
employees would be, to the nearest dollar, the
following weighted mean,

2 25,000   135,000 

 28, 333 dollars
2 1
where the weight for $25,000 is 2 and the weight for
$35,000 is 1. Since there are more than twice as many
employees in Department X as in Department Y, the
actual average salary must be even closer to $25,000
because the weight for $25,000 is greater than 2. This
means that $28,333 is the greatest possible average.
Among the choices given, the possible values of the
average are therefore $26,000 and $28,000.
Thus, the correct answer consists of Choices A and
B: $26,000 and $28,000.
Intuitively, you might expect that any amount between $25,000 and $28,333 is a possible value of the
average salary. To see that $26,000 is possible, in the
weighted mean above, use the respective weights 9
and 1 instead of 2 and 1. To see that $28,000 is possible, use the respective weights 7 and 3.

Numeric Entry Questions
Questions of this type ask you to enter a number by
filling in circles in a grid. Your answer may be an integer, a decimal, or a fraction, and it may be negative.
Tips for Answering
• Make sure you answer the question that is
asked. Since there are no answer choices to
guide you, read the question carefully and make
sure you provide the type of answer required.
Sometimes there will be labels before or after the
grid to indicate the appropriate type of answer.
Pay special attention to units such as feet or
miles, to orders of magnitude such as millions
or billions, and to percents as compared with
decimals.

28

• If you are asked to round your answer, make
sure you round to the required degree of
accuracy. For example, if an answer of 46.7
is to be rounded to the nearest integer, you
need to enter the number 47. If your solution
strategy involves intermediate computations,
you should carry out all computations exactly
and round only your final answer in order to get
the required degree of accuracy. If no rounding
instructions are given, enter the exact answer.
• Examine your answer to see if it is reasonable
with respect to the information given. You may
want to use estimation or another solution path
to double-check your answer.
Sample Questions
Directions: Enter a number by filling in circles
in a grid.
• Your answer may be an integer, a decimal, or a
fraction, and it may be negative.
• Equivalent forms of the correct answer, such as
2.5 and 2.50, are all correct. Fractions do not
need to be reduced to lowest terms, though you
may need to reduce your fraction to fit in the
grid.
• Enter the exact answer unless the question asks
you to round your answer.
• If a question asks for a fraction, the grid will
have a built-in division slash (/). Otherwise,
the grid will have a decimal point available.
• Start your answer in any column, space permitting. Fill in no more than one circle in any column of the grid. Columns not needed should
be left blank.
• Write your answer in the boxes at the top of
the grid and fill in the corresponding circles.
You will receive credit only if the circles are
filled in correctly, regardless of the number
written in the boxes at the top.

  

One way to check that the answer of 6 minutes is reasonable is to observe that if the slower rate of machine
B were the same as machine A’s faster rate of k parts in 10 minutes, then the two machines, working simultaneously, would take half the time, or 5 minutes, to produce the k parts. So the answer has to be greater than
5 minutes. Similarly, if the faster rate of machine A were the same as machine B’s slower rate of k parts in 15
minutes, then the two machines, would take half the time, or 7.5 minutes, to produce the k parts. So the answer
has to be less than 7.5 minutes. Thus, the answer of 6 minutes is reasonable compared to the lower estimate of 5
minutes and the upper estimate of 7.5 minutes.

Data Interpretation Questions
Data Interpretation questions are grouped together and refer to the same table, graph, or other data presentation.
These questions ask you to interpret or analyze the given data. The types of questions may be Multiple-choice
(both types) or Numeric Entry.
Tips for Answering
• Scan the data presentation briefly to see what it is about, but do not spend time studying all of the
information in detail. Focus on those aspects of the data that are necessary to answer the questions. Pay
attention to the axes and scales of graphs; to the units of measurement or orders of magnitude (such as
billions) that are given in the titles, labels, and legends; and to any notes that clarify the data.
• Bar graphs and circle graphs, as well as other graphical displays of data, are drawn to scale, so you can
read or estimate data visually from such graphs. For example, you can use the relative sizes of bars or
sectors to compare the quantities that they represent, but be aware of broken scales and of bars that do not
start at 0.

30

• The questions are to be answered only on the
basis of the data presented, everyday facts
(such as the number of days in a year), and
your knowledge of mathematics. Do not make
use of specialized information you may recall
from other sources about the particular context
on which the questions are based unless the
information can be derived from the data presented.

9999999

Explanation
If A is the dollar amount of sales at Store T for 2007,
then 8 percent of A, or 0.08 A, is the amount of decrease from 2007 to 2008. Thus A  0.08 A  0.92 A
is the dollar amount for 2008. Therefore, the desired
percent can be obtained by dividing A by 0.92 A,
A
1
=
= 1.0869565. . . . Exwhich equals
0.92 A 0.92
pressed as a percent and rounded to the nearest 0.1
percent, this number is 108.7%.
Thus, the correct answer is 108.7% (or equivalent).
Note that since you are asked to give the answer as
a percent, the decimal equivalent of 108.7 percent,
which is 1.087, is incorrect. The percent symbol next
to the grid indicates that the form of the answer must
be a percent. Entering 1.087 in the box would give
the erroneous answer 1.087%.

Explanation
According to Figure 6, if the dollar amount of sales
at Store P was $800,000 for 2006, then it was 10
percent greater for 2007, which is 110 percent of that
amount, or $880,000. For 2008 the amount was 90
percent of $880,000, which is $792,000.
The correct answer is Choice B, $792,000.
Note that an increase of 10 percent for one year and
a decrease of 10 percent for the following year does
not result in the same dollar amount as the original
dollar amount because the base that is used in computing the percents is $800,000 for the first change
but $880,000 for the second change.

Directions: For the following question, select all
the answer choices that apply.
3.

Based on the information given, which of the
following statements must be true?
Indicate all such statements.
a

b

c

For 2008 the dollar amount of sales at Store
R was greater than that at each of the other
four stores.
The dollar amount of sales at Store S for
2008 was 22 percent less than that for
2006.
The dollar amount of sales at Store R for
2008 was more than 17 percent greater
than that for 2006.

Explanation
For Choice A, since the only data given in Figure 6
are percent changes from year to year, there is no way
to compare the actual dollar amount of sales at the
stores for 2008 or for any other year. Even though
Store R had the greatest percent increase from 2006
to 2008, its actual dollar amount of sales for 2008
may have been much smaller than that for any of the
other four stores, and therefore Choice A is not necessarily true.
For Choice B, even though the sum of the two
percent decreases would suggest a 22 percent decrease, the bases of the percents are different. If B is
the dollar amount of sales at Store S for 2006, then
the dollar amount for 2007 is 93 percent of B, or
0.93 B, and the dollar amount for 2008 is given by
0.850.93 B, which is 0.7905B. Note that this
represents a percent decrease of 100  79.05  20.95
percent, which is less than 22 percent, and so Choice
B is not true.
For Choice C, if C is the dollar amount of sales at
Store R for 2006, then the dollar amount for 2007
is given by 1.05C and the dollar amount for 2008
is given by 1.12 1.05 C , which is 1.176C. Note
that this represents a 17.6 percent increase, which is
greater than 17 percent, so Choice C must be true.
Therefore, the correct answer consists of only
Choice C: The dollar amount of sales at Store R for
2008 was more than 17 percent greater than that
for 2006.

Using the Calculator
Sometimes the computations you need to do in order
to answer a question in the Quantitative Reasoning
measure are somewhat time-consuming, like long
division, or involve square roots. For such computations, you can use the handheld calculator provided
to you at the test site. The handheld calculator is a
basic four-function calculator with a square root
function and with buttons for memory.
Although the calculator can shorten the time it
takes to perform computations, keep in mind that
the calculator provides results that supplement, but
do not replace, your knowledge of mathematics. You
must use your mathematical knowledge to determine
whether the calculator’s results are reasonable and
how the results can be used to answer a question.
Here are some general guidelines for calculator use
in the Quantitative Reasoning measure:
• Most of the questions don’t require difficult
computations, so don’t use the calculator just
because it’s available.
• Use it for calculations that you know are tedious,
such as long division, square roots, and addition,
subtraction, or multiplication of numbers that
have several digits.
• Avoid using it for simple computations that
are quicker to do mentally, such as 10 − 490,
4 70  , 4,300 , 25, and 302.
10
• Avoid using it to introduce decimals if you are
asked to give an answer as a fraction.
• Some questions can be answered more quickly
by reasoning and estimating than by using the
calculator.
• If you use the calculator, estimate the answer
beforehand so you can determine whether the
calculator’s answer is “in the ballpark.” This may
help you avoid key-entry errors.
The following guidelines are specific to the handheld
calculator in the paper-based test:
• Some computations are not defined for real
numbers; for example, division by zero or taking
the square root of a negative number. The calculator will indicate that these are errors.
• The calculator displays up to eight digits. If a
computation results in a number greater than
99,999,999, then the calculator will indicate
that this is an error. For example, the calculation
10, 000, 000  10  results in an error.

If a computation results in a positive number
less than 0.00000001, or 10 -8 , then 0 will be
displayed.
• When a computation involves more than one
operation, the calculator performs the operations one by one in the order in which they are
entered. For example, when the computation
1  2  4 is entered into the calculator, the
result is 12. To get this result, the calculator
adds 1 and 2, displays a result of 3, and then
multiplies 3 and 4 and displays a result of 12.
The calculator does not perform operations with
respect to the mathematical convention called
order of operations, described below.
The order of operations convention, which is purely
mathematical and predates calculators, establishes
which operations are performed before others in a
mathematical expression that has more than one
operation. The order is as follows: parentheses, exponentiation (including square roots), multiplications
and divisions (from left to right), additions and subtractions (from left to right). For example, the value
of the expression 1  2  4 calculated with respect
to order of operations is 9, because the expression is
evaluated by first multiplying 2 and 4 and then by
adding 1 to the result.
Some calculators perform multiple operations
using the order of operations convention, but the
handheld calculator on the Quantitative Reasoning
measure does not; again, it performs multiple operations one by one in the order that they are entered
into the calculator.
Below is an example of a computation using the
handheld calculator.

Explanation

Taking the Practice Test
After you have become familiar with the three measures of the revised General Test, it is time to take
the practice test in this publication to see how well
you do. Not only will this help you become familiar
with the directions and types of questions, it will
help you determine how to pace yourself during an
actual test. The practice revised General Test begins
on page 35. The total time that should be allotted for
this practice test is 3 hours and 30 minutes. The time
that should be allotted for each section appears at the
beginning of the section.

Evaluating Your
Performance
After you have taken the practice revised General
Test in this publication, it is time to evaluate your
performance.
Analytical Writing Measure
One way to evaluate your performance on the Issue
and Argument topics you answered on the practice
test is to compare your essay responses to the scored
sample essay responses for these topics and review the
reader commentary. Scored sample essay responses
and reader commentary are presented in Appendix
C on pages 108–116 for the one Issue topic and one
Argument topic presented in the Analytical Writing
sections of the test.
You should review the score level descriptions
in Appendix A on page 98 to better understand the
analytical writing abilities characteristic of particular
score levels.

Perform the division first; that is, enter
6.73  2 
 4 

to get 3.365, and then enter

to get 7.365. Note that if you enter

4  6.73  2  , the answer will be incorrect, because the calculator would perform
the addition before the division, resulting in
4 + 6.73 rather than 4 + 6.73 .
2

33

Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative
Reasoning Measures
Appendix D on pages 117–118 contains information
to help you evaluate your performance on the Verbal
Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning measures.
A table of the correct answers to the questions in
the Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning
sections is provided on page 117. Compare your
answers to the correct answers given in the table,
crossing out questions you answered incorrectly or
omitted. Partially correct answers should be treated as
incorrect.
You can evaluate your performance by comparing
your performance on each test question to the
performance of a group of actual GRE test takers who
were administered those questions at previous test
administrations. In the table on page 117, there is
a number to the right of each correct answer. That
number, referred to as P+, is the percent of a group
of actual test takers who were administered that
same question at a previous test administration and
who answered it correctly. P+ is used to gauge the
relative difficulty of a test question. The higher the
P+, the easier the test question. You can use the P+
to compare your performance on each test question
to the performance of other test takers on that same
question. It can also help identify content areas in
which you need more practice and review.
For example, if the P+ for a question is 89,
that means that 89 percent of GRE test takers
who received this question answered it correctly.
Alternatively, if the P+ for a question is 14, that
means that 14 percent of GRE test takers who
received this question answered it correctly. A
question with a P+ of 89 may be interpreted as a
relatively easy question, and a question with a P+
of 14 may be interpreted as a difficult question.

34

Next, add the number of correct answers in
Sections 3 and 4 to obtain your raw Verbal Reasoning
score. Add the number of correct answers in Sections
5 and 6 to obtain your raw Quantitative Reasoning
score. Once you have calculated your raw scores, refer
to the score conversion table on page 118 to find
the scaled scores corresponding to your raw scores
on both the Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative
Reasoning measures. These scores should give you
a general idea of how you might perform on the
revised GRE General Test but they are not precise
predictions of your future test performance. The
scores provided can help guide your test preparation.
The percentile rank tables at www.ets.org/gre/
percentile allow you to compare your scaled scores
with the scores of others who have taken the General
Test. The tables provide for each score the percent of
test takers who earned lower scores (percentile rank).
To evaluate the level of your performance on the
practice test, find the percentile ranks associated with
your scores.

When one or more of the above circumstances occurs, ETS may conclude, in its professional judgment, that the
essay response does not reflect the independent writing skills that this test seeks to measure. When ETS reaches that
conclusion, it cancels the Analytical Writing score and, because Analytical Writing scores are an integral part of the
test as a whole, scores for the GRE revised General Test are canceled as well.

SECTION 2
Analytical Writing
Time—30 minutes

ANALYZE AN ARGUMENT
You have 30 minutes to plan and compose a response in which you evaluate the argument passage that appears below. A
response to any other argument will receive a score of zero. Make sure that you respond according to the specific
instructions and support your evaluation with relevant reasons and/or examples.
Note that you are NOT being asked to present your own views on the subject.

The following is taken from a memo from the advertising director of the Super Screen
Movie Production Company.
“According to a recent report from our marketing department, during the past year, fewer
people attended Super Screen-produced movies than in any other year. And yet the
percentage of positive reviews by movie reviewers about specific Super Screen movies
actually increased during the past year. Clearly, the contents of these reviews are not
reaching enough of our prospective viewers. Thus, the problem lies not with the quality of
our movies but with the public’s lack of awareness that movies of good quality are
available. Super Screen should therefore allocate a greater share of its budget next year to
reaching the public through advertising.”
Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order
to decide whether the recommendation and the argument on which it is based are
reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help to evaluate
the recommendation.

Trained GRE readers will evaluate your response for its overall quality based on how well you:
• Respond to the specific task instructions
• Identify and analyze features of the argument relevant to the assigned task
• Organize, develop, and express your ideas
• Support your analysis with relevant reasons and/or examples
• Control the elements of standard written English
Before you begin writing, you may want to think for a few minutes about the argument passage and the specific task
instructions and then plan your response. Use the next page to plan your response, then write your response starting

Instructions for Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning Sections
Important Notes
Your scores for these sections will be determined by the number of questions you answer correctly. Nothing is subtracted
from a score if you answer a question incorrectly. Therefore, to maximize your scores it is better for you to guess at an
answer than not to respond at all. Work as rapidly as you can without losing accuracy. Do not spend too much time on
questions that are too difficult for you. Go on to the other questions and come back to the difficult ones later.
Some or all of the passages in this test have been adapted from published material to provide the examinee with significant
problems for analysis and evaluation. To make the passages suitable for testing purposes, the style, content, or point of view
of the original may have been altered. The ideas contained in the passages do not necessarily represent the opinions of the
Graduate Record Examinations Board or Educational Testing Service.
You may use a calculator in the Quantitative Reasoning sections only. You will be provided with a calculator and cannot use
any other calculator.
Marking Your Answers
All answers must be marked in this test book. When filling in the circles that accompany each question, BE SURE THAT
EACH MARK IS DARK AND COMPLETELY FILLS THE CIRCLE.

Be careful to erase any stray marks that lie in or near a circle. If you change an answer, be sure that all previous marks are
erased completely. Stray marks and incomplete erasures may be read as intended answers. Scratch paper will not be
provided. You may work out your answers in the blank areas of the test book, but do not work out answers near the circles.
Question Formats
The questions in these sections have several different formats. A brief description of these formats and instructions for
entering your answer choices are given below.
Multiple-choice Questions—Select One Answer Choice
These standard multiple-choice questions require you to select just one answer choice from a list of options. You will receive
credit only if you mark the single correct answer choice and no other.

48

Multiple-choice Questions—Select One or More Answer Choices
Some of these questions specify how many answer choices to select; others require you to select all that apply. In either case,
to receive credit you must mark all of the correct answer choices and no others. These questions are distinguished by the use
of a square box.

Column Format Questions
This question type presents the answer choices in columns. You must select one answer choice from each column. You will
receive credit only if you mark the correct answer choice in each column.

Numeric Entry Questions
To answer these questions, enter a number by filling in circles in a grid. Complete instructions for doing so will be found in

Historian F. W. Maitland observed that legal
documents are the best—indeed, often the
only—available evidence about the economic and
social history of a given period. Why, then, has it
taken so long for historians to focus systematically on
the civil (noncriminal) law of early modern
(sixteenth- to eighteenth-century) England? Maitland
offered one reason: the subject requires researchers to
“master an extremely formal system of pleading and
procedure.” Yet the complexities that confront those
who would study such materials are not wholly
different from those recently surmounted by
historians of criminal law in England during the same
period. Another possible explanation for historians’
neglect of the subject is their widespread assumption
that most people in early modern England had little
contact with civil law. If that were so, the history of
legal matters would be of little relevance to general
historical scholarship. But recent research suggests
that civil litigation during the period involved
artisans, merchants, professionals, shopkeepers, and
farmers, and not merely a narrow, propertied, male
elite. Moreover, the later sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries saw an extraordinary explosion
in civil litigation by both women and men, making
this the most litigious era in English history on a
per capita basis.

Questions 12 and 13 are based on this passage.
Geese can often be seen grazing in coastal salt
marshes. Unfortunately, their intense grazing
removes the grassy covering, exposing marsh
Line sediment; this increases evaporation, which in turn
5 increases salt concentration in marsh sediments.
Because of this increased concentration, regrowth of
plants is minimal, leading to increased erosion, which
leads to a decrease in the fertile topsoil, leading to
even less regrowth. In time, the salt marsh becomes a
10 mudflat. This process challenges one of the most
widely held beliefs about the dynamics of salt-marsh
ecosystems: supposedly, consumers such as geese do
not play a large role in controlling the productivity of
marsh systems. Rather, the standard view claims,
15 marshes are controlled by bottom-up factors, such as
nutrients and physical factors.

The decrease in responsiveness that follows
continuous stimulation (adaptation) is common to all
sensory systems, including olfaction. With continued
exposure to chronically present ambient odors,
individuals’ perception of odor intensity is greatly
reduced. Moreover, these perceptual changes can be
profound and durable. It is commonly reported that
following extended absences from the odorous
environment, reexposure may still fail to elicit
perception at the original intensity.
Most research on olfactory adaptation examines
relatively transient changes in stimulus detection or
perceived intensity—rarely exceeding several hours
and often less—but because olfactory adaptation can
be produced with relatively short exposures, these
durations are sufficient for investigating many
parameters of the phenomenon. However, exposures
to odors in natural environments often occur over far
longer periods, and the resulting adaptations may
differ qualitatively from short-term olfactory
adaptation. For example, studies show that even brief
periods of odorant stimulation produce transient
reductions in receptors in the olfactory epithelium, a
process termed “receptor fatigue.” Prolonged odor
stimulation, however, could produce more
long-lasting reductions in response, possibly
involving structures higher in the central nervous
system pathway.

Among academics involved in the study of
Northern Renaissance prints (reproducible graphic
artworks), an orthodox position can be said to have
emerged. This position regards Renaissance prints as
passive representations of their time—documents that
reliably record contemporary events, opinions, and
beliefs—and therefore as an important means of
accessing the popular contemporary consciousness.
In contrast, pioneering studies such as those by
Scribner and Moxey take a strikingly different
approach, according to which Northern Renaissance
prints were purposeful, active, and important shaping
forces in the communities that produced them.
Scribner, for example, contends that religious and
political prints of the German Reformation
(ca. 1517–1555) functioned as popular propaganda:
tools in a vigorous campaign aimed at altering
people’s behavior, attitudes, and beliefs.

have been found dead of infectious diseases, and
most of these had abnormally high tissue
Line concentrations of certain compounds that, even in
5 low concentrations, reduce dolphins’ resistance to
infection. The only source of these compounds in the
dolphins’ environment is boat paint. Therefore, since
dolphins rid their bodies of the compounds rapidly
once exposure ceases, their mortality rate should
decline rapidly if such boat paints are banned.

25. Which of the following, if true, most strengthens
the argument?
A The levels of the compounds typically used in

boat paints today are lower than they were in
boat paints manufactured a decade ago.
B In high concentrations, the compounds are

toxic to many types of marine animals.
C The compounds break down into harmless

substances after a few months of exposure to
water or air.
D High tissue levels of the compounds have

recently been found in some marine animals,
but there is no record of any of those animals
dying in unusually large numbers recently.
E The compounds do not leach out of the boat

paint if the paint is applied exactly in
accordance with the manufacturer’s directions.

The work of English writer Aphra Behn
(1640–1689) changed markedly during the 1680s, as
she turned from writing plays to writing prose
narratives. According to literary critic
Rachel Carnell, most scholars view this change as
primarily motivated by financial considerations:
earning a living by writing for the theatre became
more difficult in the 1680s, so Behn tried various
other types of prose genres in the hope of finding
another lucrative medium. In fact, a long epistolary
scandal novel that she wrote in the mid-1680s sold
quite well. Yet, as Carnell notes, Behn did not repeat
this approach in her other prose works; instead, she
turned to writing shorter, more serious novels, even
though only about half of these were published during
her lifetime. Carnell argues that Behn, whose stage
productions are primarily comedies, may have turned
to an emerging literary form, the novel, in a conscious
attempt to criticize, and subvert for her own ends, the
conventions and ideology of a well-established form
of her day, the dramatic tragedy.
Carnell acknowledges that Behn admired the skill
of such contemporary writers of dramatic tragedy as
John Dryden, and that Behn’s own comic stage
productions displayed the same partisanship for the
reigning Stuart monarchy that characterized most of
the politically oriented dramatic tragedies of her day.
However, Carnell argues that Behn took issue with
the way in which these writers and plays defined the
nature of tragedy. As prescribed by Dryden, tragedy
was supposed to concern a heroic man who is a public
figure and who undergoes a fall that evokes pity from
the audience. Carnell points out that Behn’s tragic
novels focus instead on the plight of little-known
women and the private world of the household; even
in her few novels featuring male protagonists, Behn
insists on the importance of the crimes these
otherwise heroic figures commit in the domestic
sphere. Moreover, according to Carnell, Behn
questioned the view promulgated by monarchist
dramatic tragedies such as Dryden’s: that the
envisioned “public” political ideal—passive
obedience to the nation’s king—ought to be mirrored
in the private sphere, with family members wholly
obedient to a male head of household. Carnell sees
Behn’s novels not only as rejecting the model of

4

4

4

4

4

4

patriarchal and hierarchical family order, but also as
warning that insisting on such a parallel can result in
real tragedy befalling the members of the domestic
50 sphere. According to Carnell, Behn’s choice of
literary form underscores the differences between her
own approach to crafting a tragic story and that taken
in the dramatic tragedies, with their artificial
distinction between the public and private spheres.
55 Behn’s novels engage in the political dialogue of her
era by demonstrating that the good of the nation
ultimately encompasses more than the good of the
public figures who rule it.

tragedy changed over time

Questions 13 and 14 are based on this passage.

Question 15 is based on this passage.

Computers cannot accurately predict climate
change unless the mathematical equations fed into
them adequately capture the natural meteorological
Line processes they are intended to simulate. Moreover,
5 there are processes that influence climate, such as
modifications in land use, that scientists do not know
how to simulate. The failure to incorporate such a
process into a computer climate model can lead the
model astray because a small initial effect can initiate
10 a feedback cycle: a perturbation in one variable
modifies a second variable, which in turn amplifies
the original disturbance. An increase in temperature,
for example, can boost the moisture content of the
atmosphere, which then causes further warming
because water vapor is a greenhouse gas.

Line that Europeans needed to “transform” chocolate to
5 make it appetizing. However, while Spaniards did put
sugar, which was unknown to indigenous Americans,
into chocolate beverages, this additive was not
completely innovative. Mesoamericans were already
sweetening chocolate with honey, and the step from
10 honey to sugar—increasingly more available than
honey because of expanding sugar plantations in the
Americas—is a small one. Likewise, although
Spaniards adjusted Mesoamerican recipes by using
European spices, the spices chosen suggest an

Biologists generally agree that birds and dinosaurs
are somehow related to one another. The agreement
ends there. Hypotheses regarding dinosaurian and
avian evolution are unusually diverse—and often at
odds with one another. Confusion consequently
reigns over a broad spectrum of unanswered
questions dealing with avian origins and the biology
of dinosaurs and early birds. This confusion has been
exacerbated by a paucity of serious attempts to
synthesize and evaluate available data on the details
of avian and dinosaurian evolution. Too often, the job
of summarizing current knowledge of these subjects
has fallen to well-meaning but naïve lay authors or
reporters. Consequently, both the public and the
scientific community have often been misled by
widespread dissemination of sensational but weakly
founded hypotheses.

A portrait type that appeared with relentless
frequency in eighteenth-century England is the
familiar image of a gentleman poised with one hand
inside his partially unbuttoned waistcoat. Standard
interpretations of this portrait posture offer
observations of correspondence—demonstrating
either that it mirrors actual social behavior or that it
borrows from classical statuary. Such explanations,
however, illuminate neither the source of this curious
convention nor the reason for its popularity. It is true
that in real life the “hand-in” was a common stance
for elite men. Still, there were other ways of
comporting the body that did not become winning
portrait formulas. And even if the “hand-in” portrait
does resemble certain classical statues, what accounts
for the adoption of this particular pose?

24. In the context of the passage as a whole, the
primary function of the sentence in lines 10-12
(“ It is . . . men”) is to
A emphasize the influence of a particular social

class on the conventions of eighteenth-century
English portraiture
B account for the origin of a particular type of

behavior frequently represented in
eighteenth-century English portraiture
C acknowledge a historical basis for two

competing hypotheses about a particular
portrait type
D question the relevance of certain evidence

frequently cited in support of an explanation
for a particular portrait type
E concede that one explanation for the

prevalence of a particular portrait type has a
basis in fact

25 Questions

For each question, indicate the best answer, using the directions given.
Notes: All numbers used are real numbers.
All figures are assumed to lie in a plane unless otherwise indicated.
Geometric figures, such as lines, circles, triangles, and quadrilaterals, are not necessarily drawn to
scale. That is, you should not assume that quantities such as lengths and angle measures are as they
appear in a figure. You should assume, however, that lines shown as straight are actually straight,
points on a line are in the order shown, and more generally, all geometric objects are in the relative
positions shown. For questions with geometric figures, you should base your answers on geometric
reasoning, not on estimating or comparing quantities by sight or by measurement.
Coordinate systems, such as xy-planes and number lines, are drawn to scale; therefore, you can read,
estimate, or compare quantities in such figures by sight or by measurement.
Graphical data presentations, such as bar graphs, circle graphs, and line graphs, are drawn to scale;
therefore, you can read, estimate, or compare data values by sight or by measurement.
For each of Questions 1 to 9, compare Quantity A and Quantity B, using additional information centered
above the two quantities if such information is given. Select one of the following four answer choices and
fill in the corresponding circle to the right of the question.
(A)

Analytical Writing Score
Level Descriptions
Although the GRE Analytical Writing measure
contains two discrete analytical writing tasks, a single
combined score is reported because it is more reliable
than is a score for either task alone.
The statements below describe, for each score
level, the overall quality of analytical writing demonstrated across both the Issue and Argument tasks.
Because the test assesses “analytical writing,” critical thinking skills (the ability to reason, assemble
evidence to develop a position and communicate
complex ideas) weigh more heavily than the writer’s
control of fine points of grammar or the mechanics of
writing (e.g., spelling).
SCORES 6 and 5.5 – Sustains insightful, in-depth
analysis of complex ideas; develops and supports
main points with logically compelling reasons and/or
highly persuasive examples; is well focused and well
organized; skillfully uses sentence variety and precise
vocabulary to convey meaning effectively; demonstrates superior facility with sentence structure and
language usage but may have minor errors that do not
interfere with meaning.
SCORES 5 and 4.5 – Provides generally thoughtful analysis of complex ideas; develops and supports
main points with logically sound reasons and/or
well-chosen examples; is generally focused and well
organized; uses sentence variety and vocabulary to
convey meaning clearly; demonstrates good control
of sentence structure and language usage but may
have minor errors that do not interfere with meaning.

98

SCORES 4 and 3.5 – Provides competent analysis
of ideas; develops and supports main points with
relevant reasons and/or examples; is adequately
organized; conveys meaning with reasonable clarity;
demonstrates satisfactory control of sentence structure and language usage but may have some errors
that affect clarity.
SCORES 3 and 2.5 – Displays some competence in
analytical writing, although the writing is flawed in
at least one of the following ways: limited analysis
or development; weak organization; weak control of
sentence structure or language usage, with errors that
often result in vagueness or lack of clarity.
SCORES 2 and 1.5 – Displays serious weaknesses
in analytical writing. The writing is seriously flawed
in at least one of the following ways: serious lack of
analysis or development; lack of organization; serious and frequent problems in sentence structure or
language usage, with errors that obscure meaning.
SCORE 1 and 0.5 – Displays fundamental deficiencies in analytical writing. The writing is fundamentally flawed in at least one of the following ways:
content that is extremely confusing or mostly irrelevant to the assigned tasks; little or no development;
severe and pervasive errors that result in incoherence.
SCORE 0 – The examinee’s analytical writing skills
cannot be evaluated because the responses do not
address any part of the assigned tasks, are merely
attempts to copy the assignments, are in a foreign
language or display only indecipherable text.
SCORE “NS” – The examinee produced no text

As people rely more and more on technology to
solve problems, the ability of humans to think for
themselves will surely deteriorate.
Discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree
with the statement and explain your reasoning for
the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in
which the statement might or might not hold true
and explain how these considerations shape your
position.

Essay Response – Score 6
The statement linking technology negatively with
free thinking plays on recent human experience over
the past century. Surely there has been no time in
history where the lived lives of people have changed
more dramatically. A quick reflection on a typical day
reveals how technology has revolutionized the world.
Most people commute to work in an automobile that
runs on an internal combustion engine. During the
workday, chances are high that the employee will interact with a computer that processes information on
silicon bridges that are .09 microns wide. Upon leaving home, family members will be reached through
wireless networks that utilize satellites orbiting the
earth. Each of these common occurrences could have
been inconceivable at the turn of the 19th century.
The statement attempts to bridge these dramatic
changes to a reduction in the ability for humans
to think for themselves. The assumption is that an
increased reliance on technology negates the need for
people to think creatively to solve previous quandaries. Looking back at the introduction, one could
argue that without a car, computer, or mobile phone,
the hypothetical worker would need to find alternate
methods of transport, information processing and

communication. Technology short circuits this thinking by making the problems obsolete.
However, this reliance on technology does not
necessarily preclude the creativity that marks the human species. The prior examples reveal that technology allows for convenience. The car, computer and
phone all release additional time for people to live
more efficiently. This efficiency does not preclude
the need for humans to think for themselves. In
fact, technology frees humanity to not only tackle
new problems, but may itself create new issues that
did not exist without technology. For example, the
proliferation of automobiles has introduced a need
for fuel conservation on a global scale. With increasing energy demands from emerging markets, global
warming becomes a concern inconceivable to the
horse-and-buggy generation. Likewise dependence on
oil has created nation-states that are not dependent
on taxation, allowing ruling parties to oppress minority groups such as women. Solutions to these complex problems require the unfettered imaginations of
maverick scientists and politicians.
In contrast to the statement, we can even see how
technology frees the human imagination. Consider
how the digital revolution and the advent of the internet has allowed for an unprecedented exchange of
ideas. WebMD, a popular internet portal for medical
information, permits patients to self research symptoms for a more informed doctor visit. This exercise
opens pathways of thinking that were previously
closed off to the medical layman. With increased
interdisciplinary interactions, inspiration can arrive
from the most surprising corners. Jeffrey Sachs, one
of the architects of the UN Millenium Development Goals, based his ideas on emergency care triage
techniques. The unlikely marriage of economics and
medicine has healed tense, hyperinflation environments from South America to Eastern Europe.
This last example provides the most hope in how
technology actually provides hope to the future of
humanity. By increasing our reliance on technology, impossible goals can now be achieved. Consider
how the late 20th century witnessed the complete
elimination of smallpox. This disease had ravaged the
human race since prehistorical days, and yet with the
technology of vaccines, free thinking humans dared
to imagine a world free of smallpox. Using technology, battle plans were drawn out, and smallpox was
systematically targeted and eradicated.

99

Technology will always mark the human experience, from the discovery of fire to the implementation of nanotechnology. Given the history of the
human race, there will be no limit to the number of
problems, both new and old, for us to tackle. There
is no need to retreat to a Luddite attitude to new
things, but rather embrace a hopeful posture to the
possibilities that technology provides for new avenues
of human imagination.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 6
The author of this essay stakes out a clear and insightful position on the issue and follows the specific
instructions by presenting reasons to support that
position. The essay cogently argues that technology
does not decrease our ability to think for ourselves,
but merely provides “additional time for people to
live more efficiently.” In fact, the problems that
have developed alongside the growth of technology
(pollution, political unrest in oil-producing nations)
actually call for more creative thinking, not less.
In further examples, the essay shows how technology allows for the linking of ideas that may never
have been connected in the past (like medicine and
economic models), pushing people to think in new
ways. Examples are persuasive and fully developed;
reasoning is logically sound and well supported.
Ideas in the essay are connected logically, with
effective transitions used both between paragraphs
(“However” or “In contrast to the statement”) and
within paragraphs. Sentence structure is varied and
complex and the essay clearly demonstrates facility
with the “conventions of standard written English
(i.e., grammar, usage and mechanics)” (see “Analyze
an Issue” Scoring Guide on pages 94–95), with only
minor errors appearing. Thus, this essay meets all the
requirements for receiving a top score, a 6.
Essay Response – Score 5
Surely many of us have expressed the following
sentiment, or some variation on it, during our daily
commutes to work: “People are getting so stupid
these days!” Surrounded as we are by striding and
strident automatons with cell phones glued to their
ears, PDA’s gripped in their palms, and omniscient,
omnipresent CNN gleaming in their eyeballs, it’s
tempting to believe that technology has isolated and
infantilized us, essentally transforming us into dependent, conformist morons best equipped to sideswip
one another in our SUV’s.

100

Furthermore, hanging around with the younger,
pre-commute generation, whom tech-savviness
seems to have rendered lethal, is even less reassuring.
With “Teen People” style trends shooting through
the air from tiger-striped PDA to zebra-striped PDA,
and with the latest starlet gossip zipping from juicy
Blackberry to teeny, turbo-charged cell phone,
technology seems to support young people’s worst
tendencies to follow the crowd. Indeed, they have
seemingly evolved into intergalactic conformity police. After all, today’s tech-aided teens are, courtesy
of authentic, hands-on video games, literally trained
to kill; courtesy of chat and instant text messaging,
they have their own language; they even have tiny
cameras to efficiently photodocument your fashion
blunders! Is this adolescence, or paparazzi terrorist
training camp?
With all this evidence, it’s easy to believe that
tech trends and the incorporation of technological
wizardry into our everyday lives have served mostly to
enforce conformity, promote dependence, heighten
comsumerism and materialism, and generally create
a culture that values self-absorption and personal
entitlement over cooperation and collaboration.
However, I argue that we are merely in the inchoate stages of learning to live with technology while
still loving one another. After all, even given the
examples provided earlier in this essay, it seems clear
that technology hasn’t impaired our thinking and
problem-solving capacities. Certainly it has incapacitated our behavior and manners; certainly our values
have taken a severe blow. However, we are inarguably
more efficient in our badness these days. We’re effective worker bees of ineffectiveness!
If T\technology has so increased our senses of
self-efficacy that we can become veritable agents of
the awful, virtual CEO’s of selfishness, certainly it
can be beneficial. Harnessed correctly, technology
can improve our ability to think and act for ourselves.
The first challenge is to figure out how to provide
technology users with some direly-needed direction.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 5
The language of this essay clearly illustrates both its
strengths and weaknesses. The flowery and sometimes
uncannily keen descriptions are often used to powerful effect, but at other times this descriptive language
results in errors in syntax. See, for example, the problems of parallelism in the second-to-last sentence of
paragraph 2 (“After all, today’s tech-aided teens ...”).

There is consistent evidence of facility with syntax and complex vocabulary (“Surrounded as we are
by striding and strident automatons with cell phones
glued to their ears, PDA’s gripped in their palms, and
omniscient, omnipresent CNN gleaming in their
eyeballs, it’s tempting to believe...”). However, such
lucid prose is often countered by an over-reliance on
abstractions and tangential reasoning. For example,
what does the fact that video games “literally train
[teens] to kill” have to do with the use or deterioration of thinking abilities?
Because this essay takes a complex approach to
the issue (arguing, in effect, that technology neither
enhances nor reduces our ability to think for ourselves, but can do one or the other, depending on the
user) and because the author makes use of “appropriate vocabulary and sentence variety” (see “Analyze
an Issue” Scoring Guide on page 94), a score of 5 is
appropriate.

Right now we are seeing a golden age of technology, using it all the time during our every day
lives. When we get up there’s instant coffee and the
microwave and all these great things that help us get
ready for our day. But we aren’t allowing our minds to
deteriorate by using them, we are only making things
easier for ourselves and saving time for other important things in our days. Going off to school or work
in our cars instead of a horse and buggy. Think of
the brain power and genius that was used to come up
with that single invention that has changed the way
we move across this globe.
Using technology to solve our continually more
complicated problems as a human race is definately
a good thing. Our ability to think for ourselves isn’t
deteriorating, it’s continuing to grow, moving on to
higher though functions and more ingenious ideas.

In all actuality, I think it is more probable that our
bodies will surely deteriorate long before our minds
do in any significant amount. Who can’t say that
technology has made us lazier, but that’s the key
word, lazy, not stupid. The ever increasing amount
of technology that we incorporate into our daily
lives makes people think and learn every day, possibly more than ever before. Our abilities to think,
learn, philosophize, etc. may even reach limits never
dreamed of before by average people. Using technology to solve problems will continue to help us realize
our potential as a human race.
If you think about it, using technology to solve
more complicating problems gives humans a chance
to expand their thinking and learning, opening up
whole new worlds for many people. Many of these
people are glad for the chance to expand their horizons by learning more, going to new places, and trying new things. If it wasn’t for the invention of new
technological devices, I wouldn’t be sitting at this
computer trying to philosophize about technology. It
would be extremely hard for children in much poorer
countries to learn and think for themselves with out
the invention of the internet. Think what an impact
the printing press, a technologically superior mackine
at the time, had on the ability of the human race to
learn and think.

This essay meets all the criteria of a level-4 essay. The
writer develops a clear position (“Using technology
to solve our problems will continue to help us realize
our potential as a human race”). The position is then
developed with relevant reasons (“using technology
to solve more complicat[ed] problems gives humans
a chance to expand their thinking and learning” and
“we are seeing a golden age of technology”).
Point 1, “using technology,” is supported with the
simple but relevant notion that technology allows
us access to information and abilities to which we
would not normally have access. Similarly, point 2,
the “golden age,” is supported by the basic description of our technologically saturated social condition.
Though the overall development and organization of
the essay does suffer from an occasional misdirection
(see paragraph 3’s abrupt progression from coffee pots
to the benefits of technology to cars), the essay as a
whole flows smoothly and logically from one idea to
the next.
It is useful to compare this essay to the level-3
essay presented next. Though both essays entail some
surface-level discussion and often fail to probe deeply
into the issue, this writer does take the analysis a step
further. In paragraph 2, the distinction between this
essay and the next one (the level-3 response) can
most clearly be seen. To support the notion that advances in technology actually help increase thinking
ability, the writer draws a clever parallel between the

101

promise of modern, sophisticated technology (computer) and the actual “impact” of equally “promising” and pervasive technologies of the past (printing
press).
Like the analysis, the language in this essay clearly
meets the requirements for a score of 4. The writer
displays sufficient control of language and the conventions of standard written English. The preponderance of mistakes are of a cosmetic nature (“trying to
solve more complicating problems.”) There is a sentence fragment (“Going off ...”) along with a comma
splice (“Our ability ... isn’t deteriorating, it’s continuing to grow ...”) in paragraph 3. However, these errors
are minor and do not interfere with the clarity of the
ideas being presented.
Essay Response – Score 3
There is no current proof that advancing technology will deteriorate the ability of humans to think.
On the contrary, advancements in technology had
advanced our vast knowledge in many fields, opening
opportunities for further understanding and achievement. For example, the problem of dibilitating illnesses and diseases such as alzheimer’s disease is slowing being solved by the technological advancements
in stem cell research. The future ability of growing
new brain cells and the possibility to reverse the
onset of alzheimer’s is now becoming a reality. This
shows our initiative as humans to better our health
demonstrates greater ability of humans to think.
One aspect where the ability of humans may
initially be seen as an example of deteriorating minds
is the use of internet and cell phones. In the past
humans had to seek out information in many different enviroments and aspects of life. Now humans can
sit in a chair and type anything into a computer and
get an answer. Our reliance on this type of technology can be detrimental if not regulated and regularily substituted for other information sources such as
human interactions and hands on learning. I think if
humans understand that we should not have such a
reliance on computer technology, that we as a species
will advance further by utilizing the opportunity of
computer technology as well as the other sources of
information outside of a computer. Supplementing
our knowledge with internet access is surely a way
for technology to solve problems while continually
advancing the human race.

102

Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 3
This essay never moves beyond a superficial discussion of the issue. The writer attempts to develop
two points: that advancements in technology have
progressed our knowledge in many fields and that
supplementing rather than relying on technology is
“surely a way for technology to solve problems while
continually advancing the human race.” Each point,
then, is developed with relevant but insufficient
evidence. In discussing the potential of technology to
advance knowledge in many fields (a broad subject,
rife with possible examples), the writer uses only one
limited and very brief example from a specific field
(medicine and stem-cell research).
Development of the second point is hindered
by a lack of specificity and organization. The writer
creates what might be best described as an outline.
The writer cites a need for regulation/supplementation and warns of the detriment of over-reliance
upon technology. However, the explanation of both
the problem and solution is vague and limited (“Our
reliance ... can be detrimental. If humans understand
that we should not have such a reliance ... we will
advance further”). There is neither explanation of
consequences nor clarification of what is meant by
“supplementing.” This second paragraph is a series of
generalizations that are loosely connected and lack a
much-needed grounding.
In the essay, there are some minor language errors
and a few more serious flaws (e.g., “The future ability
of growing new brain cells” or “One aspect where the
ability of humans may initially be seen as an example
of deteriorating minds”). Despite the accumulation
of such flaws, the writer’s meaning is generally clear.
Because of its limited development, however, this
essay earns a score of 3.
Essay Response – Score 2
In recent centuries, humans have developed the technology very rapidly, and you may accept some merit
of it, and you may see a distortion in society occured
by it. To be lazy for human in some meaning is one
of the fashion issues in thesedays. There are many
symptoms and resons of it. However, I can not agree
with the statement that the technology make humans
to be reluctant to thinkng thoroughly.
Of course, you can see the phenomena of human laziness along with developed technology in
some place. However, they would happen in specific
condition, not general. What makes human to be

laze of thinking is not merely technology, but the the
tendency of human that they treat them as a magic
stick and a black box. Not understanding the aims
and theory of them couses the disapproval problems.
The most important thing to use the thechnology, regardless the new or old, is to comprehend the
fundamental idea of them, and to adapt suit tech to
tasks in need. Even if you recognize a method as a allmighty and it is extremely over-spec to your needs,
you can not see the result you want. In this procedure, humans have to consider as long as possible to
acquire adequate functions. Therefore, humans can
not escape from using their brain.
In addition, the technology as it is do not vain automatically, the is created by humans. Thus, the more
developed tech and the more you want a convenient
life, the more you think and emmit your creativity to
breakthrough some banal method sarcastically.
Consequently, if you are not passive to the new
tech, but offensive to it, you would not lose your ability to think deeply. Furthermore, you may improve
the ability by adopting it.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 2
The language of this essay is what most clearly links it
to the score of 2. Amidst sporadic moments of clarity,
this essay is marred by serious errors in grammar, usage and mechanics that often interfere with meaning. It is unclear what the writer means when he/she
states, “To be lazy for human in some meaning is one
of the fashion issues in thesedays,” or “to adapt suit
tech to tasks in need.”
Despite such severe flaws, the writer has made an
obvious attempt to respond to the prompt (“I can not
agree with the statement that the technology make
humans to be reluctant to thinking thoroughly”) as
well as an unclear attempt to support such an assertion (“Not understanding the aims and theory of
them [technology] couses the disapproval problems”
and “The most important thing to use the thechnology ... is to comprehend the fundamental idea of
them”). On the whole, the essay displays a seriously
flawed but not fundamentally deficient attempt to
develop and support its claims.
(NOTE: In this specific case, the analysis is tied directly to the language. As the language falters, so too
does the analysis.)

Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 1
The essay is clearly on topic, as evidenced by the
writer’s usage of the more significant terms from the
prompt: “technically” (technologically), “humans,”
“thinking” (think) and “deteriorating” (deteriorate).
Such usage is the only clear evidence of understanding. Meaning aside, the brevity of the essay (one
sentence) clearly indicates the writer’s inability to
develop a response that follows the specific instructions given (“Discuss the extent to which you agree
or disagree with the statement above and explain
your reasoning for the position you take”).
The language, too, is clearly level 1, as the sentence fails to achieve coherence. The coherent
phrases in this one-sentence response are those tied
to the prompt: “Humans have invented machines”
and “their thinking process is deteriorating.” Otherwise, the point being made is unclear.

Argument Task Essay Responses and
Reader Commentary
Sample Argument Task
In surveys Mason City residents rank water sports
(swimming, boating and fishing) among their
favorite recreational activities. The Mason River
flowing through the city is rarely used for these
pursuits, however, and the city park department
devotes little of its budget to maintaining riverside
recreational facilities. For years there have been
complaints from residents about the quality of the
river’s water and the river’s smell. In response, the
state has recently announced plans to clean up
Mason River. Use of the river for water sports is
therefore sure to increase. The city government
should for that reason devote more money in this
year’s budget to riverside recreational facilities.
Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument.
Be sure to explain how the argument depends on
the assumptions and what the implications are if
these assumptions prove unwarranted.

While it may be true that the Mason City government ought to devote more money to riverside
recreational facilities, this author’s argument does not
make a cogent case for increased resources based on
river use. It is easy to understand why city residents
would want a cleaner river, but this argument is rife
with holes and assumptions, and thus, not strong
enough to lead to increased funding.
Citing surveys of city residents, the author reports
city resident’s love of water sports. It is not clear,
however, the scope and validity of that survey. For
example, the survey could have asked residents if
they prefer using the river for water sports or would
like to see a hydroelectric dam built, which may have
swayed residents toward river sports. The sample may
not have been representative of city residents, asking
only those residents who live upon the river. The
survey may have been 10 pages long, with 2 questions
dedicated to river sports. We just do not know. Unless
the survey is fully representative, valid, and reliable,
it can not be used to effectively back the author’s
argument.
Additionally, the author implies that residents do
not use the river for swimming, boating, and fishing,
despite their professed interest, because the water is
polluted and smelly. While a polluted, smelly river
would likely cut down on river sports, a concrete
connection between the resident’s lack of river use
and the river’s current state is not effectively made.
Though there have been complaints, we do not know
if there have been numerous complaints from a wide
range of people, or perhaps from one or two individuals who made numerous complaints. To strengthen
his/her argument, the author would benefit from
implementing a normed survey asking a wide range of
residents why they do not currently use the river.
Building upon the implication that residents do
not use the river due to the quality of the river’s water
and the smell, the author suggests that a river clean
up will result in increased river usage. If the river’s
water quality and smell result from problems which
can be cleaned, this may be true. For example, if
the decreased water quality and aroma is caused by
pollution by factories along the river, this conceivably could be remedied. But if the quality and aroma
results from the natural mineral deposits in the water
or surrounding rock, this may not be true. There are
some bodies of water which emit a strong smell of
sulphur due to the geography of the area. This is not

104

something likely to be afffected by a clean-up. Consequently, a river clean up may have no impact upon
river usage. Regardless of whether the river’s quality
is able to be improved or not, the author does not
effectively show a connection between water quality
and river usage.
A clean, beautiful, safe river often adds to a city’s
property values, leads to increased tourism and revenue from those who come to take advantage of the
river, and a better overall quality of life for residents.
For these reasons, city government may decide to
invest in improving riverside recreational facilities.
However, this author’s argument is not likely significantly persuade the city goverment to allocate
increased funding.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 6
This insightful response identifies important assumptions and thoroughly examines their implications.
The proposal to spend more on riverside recreational
facilities rests on several questionable assumptions,
namely:
• that the survey provides a reliable basis for budget planning
• that the river’s pollution and odor are the only
reasons for its limited recreational use
• that efforts to clean the water and remove the
odor will be successful
By showing that each assumption is highly suspect,
this essay demonstrates the weakness of the entire argument. For example, paragraph 2 points out that the
survey might not have used a representative sample,
might have offered limited choices, and might have
contained very few questions on water sports.
Paragraph 3 examines the tenuous connection
between complaints and limited use of the river for
recreation. Complaints about water quality and odor
may be coming from only a few people and, even
if such complaints are numerous, other completely
different factors may be much more significant in
reducing river usage. Finally, paragraph 4 explains
that certain geologic features may prevent effective
river clean-up. Details such as these provide compelling support.
In addition, careful organization ensures that
each new point builds upon the previous ones. For
example, note the clear transitions at the beginning of
paragraphs 3 and 4, as well as the logical sequence of
sentences within paragraphs (specifically paragraph 4).

Although this essay does contain minor errors, it
still conveys ideas fluently. Note the effective word
choices (e.g., “rife with . . . assumptions” and “may
have swayed residents”). In addition, sentences are
not merely varied; they also display skillful embedding of subordinate elements. For example, note
the sustained parallelism in the first sentence of the
concluding paragraph.
Since this response offers cogent examination of
the argument and conveys meaning skillfully, it earns
a score of 6.
Essay Response – Score 5
The author of this proposal to increase the budget for
Mason City riverside recreational facilities offers an
interesting argument but to move forward on the proposal would definitely require more information and
thought. While the correlations stated are logical and
probable, there may be hidden factors that prevent
the City from diverting resources to this project.
For example, consider the survey rankings among
Mason City residents. The thought is that such high
regard for water sports will translate into usage. But,
survey responses can hardly be used as indicators of
actual behavior. Many surveys conducted after the
winter holidays reveal people who list exercise and
weight loss as a top priority. Yet every profession does
not equal a new gym membership. Even the wording
of the survey results remain ambiguous and vague.
While water sports may be among the residents’
favorite activities, this allows for many other
favorites. What remains unknown is the priorities of
the general public. Do they favor these water sports
above a softball field or soccer field? Are they willing
to sacrifice the municipal golf course for better
riverside facilities? Indeed the survey hardly provides
enough information to discern future use of improved
facilities.
Closely linked to the surveys is the bold assumption that a cleaner river will result in increased usage.
While it is not illogical to expect some increase, at
what level will people begin to use the river? The
answer to this question requires a survey to find out
the reasons our residents use or do not use the river.
Is river water quality the primary limiting factor
to usage or the lack of docks and piers? Are people
more interested in water sports than the recreational
activities that they are already engaged in? These
questions will help the city government forecast how

much river usage will increase and to assign a proportional increase to the budget.
Likewise, the author is optimistic regarding the
state promise to clean the river. We need to hear the
source of the voices and consider any ulterior motives. Is this a campaign year and the plans a campaign promise from the state representative? What
is the timeline for the clean-up effort? Will the state
fully fund this project? We can imagine the misuse
of funds in renovating the riverside facilities only to
watch the new buildings fall into dilapidation while
the state drags the river clean-up.
Last, the author does not consider where these
additional funds will be diverted from. The current
budget situation must be assessed to determine if this
increase can be afforded. In a sense, the City may not
be willing to draw money away from other key projects from road improvements to schools and education. The author naively assumes that the money can
simply appear without forethought on where it will
come from.
Examining all the various angles and factors
involved with improving riverside recreational facilities, the argument does not justify increasing the budget. While the proposal does highlight a possibility,
more information is required to warrant any action.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 5
Each paragraph in the body of this perceptive essay
identifies and examines an unstated assumption that
is crucial to the argument. The major assumptions
discussed are:
• that a survey can accurately predict behavior
• that cleaning the river will, in itself, increase
recreational usage
• that state plans to clean the river will actually
be realized
• that Mason City can afford to spend more on
riverside recreational facilities
Support within each paragraph is both thoughtful
and thorough. For example, paragraph 2 points out
vagueness in the wording of the survey: Even if water
sports rank among the favorite recreational activities of Mason City residents, other sports may still
be much more popular. Thus, if the first assumption
proves unwarranted, the argument to fund riverside
facilities—rather than soccer fields or golf courses—
becomes much weaker. Paragraph 4 considers several
reasons why river clean-up plans may not be successful (the plans may be nothing more than campaign

105

promises or funding may not be adequate). Thus,
the weakness of the third assumption undermines
the argument that river recreation will increase and
riverside improvements will be needed at all.
Instead of dismissing each assumption in isolation, this response places them in a logical order and
considers their connections. Note the appropriate
transitions between and within paragraphs, clarifying the links among the assumptions (e.g., “Closely
linked to the surveys …” or “The answer to this question requires …”).
Along with strong development, this response
also displays facility with language. Minor errors in
punctuation are present, but word choices are apt and
sentences suitably varied in pattern and length. The
response uses a number of rhetorical questions, but
the implied answers are always clear enough to support the points being made.
Thus, the response satisfies all requirements for
a score of 5, but its development is not thorough or
compelling enough for a 6.

The problem with the arguement is the assumption
that if the Mason River were cleaned up, that people
would use it for water sports and recreation. This is
not necessarily true, as people may rank water sports
among their favorite recreational activities, but that
does not mean that those same people have the
financial ability, time or equipment to pursue those
interests.
However, even if the writer of the arguement is
correct in assuming that the Mason River will be used
more by the city’s residents, the arguement does not
say why the recreational facilities need more money.
If recreational facilities already exist along the Mason
River, why should the city allot more money to fund
them? If the recreational facilities already in existence will be used more in the coming years, then
they will be making more money for themselves,
eliminating the need for the city government to
devote more money to them.
According to the arguement, the reason people
are not using the Mason River for water sports is
because of the smell and the quality of water, not
because the recreational facilities are unacceptable.
If the city government alloted more money to the
recreational facilities, then the budget is being cut
from some other important city project. Also, if the
assumptions proved unwarranted, and more people

106

did not use the river for recreation, then much money
has been wasted, not only the money for the recreational facilities, but also the money that was used to
clean up the river to attract more people in the first
place.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 4
This competent response identifies some important
unstated assumptions:
• that cleaning up the Mason River will lead to
increased recreational use
• that existing facilities along the river need more
funding
Paragraph 1 offers reasons why the first assumption
is questionable (e.g., residents may not have the
necessary time or money for water sports). Similarly,
paragraphs 2 and 3 explain that riverside recreational
facilities may already be adequate and may, in fact,
produce additional income if usage increases. Thus,
the response is adequately developed and satisfactorily organized to show how the argument depends on
questionable assumptions.
However, this essay does not rise to a score of 5
because it fails to consider several other unstated assumptions (e.g., that the survey is reliable or that the
efforts to clean the river will be successful). Furthermore, the final paragraph makes some extraneous,
unsupported assertions of its own. Mason City may
actually have a budget surplus so that cuts to other
projects will not be necessary, and cleaning the river
may provide other real benefits even if it is not used
more for water sports.
This response is generally free of errors in grammar and usage and displays sufficient control of
language to support a score of 4.

Surveys are created to speak for the people; however,
surveys do not always speak for the whole community. A survey completed by Mason City residents
concluded that the residents enjoy water sports as a
form of recreation. If that is so evident, why has the
river not been used? The blame can not be soley be
placed on the city park department. The city park
department can only do as much as they observe.
The real issue is not the residents use of the river,
but their desire for a more pleasant smell and a more
pleasant sight. If the city government cleans the
river, it might take years for the smell to go away. If
the budget is changed to accomodate the clean up

of the Mason River, other problems will arise. The
residents will then begin to complain about other
issues in their city that will be ignored because of the
great emphasis being placed on Mason River. If more
money is taken out of the budget to clean the river an
assumption can be made. This assumption is that the
budget for another part of city maintenance or building will be tapped into to. In addition, to the budget
being used to clean up Mason River, it will also be
allocated in increasing riverside recreational facilites.
The government is trying to appease its residents, and
one can warrant that the role of the government is to
please the people. There are many assumptions being
made; however, the government can not make the assumption that people want the river to be cleaned so
that they can use it for recreational water activities.
The government has to realize the long term effects
that their decision will have on the monetary value
of their budget.

Even though much of this essay is tangential, it offers
some relevant examination of the argument’s assumptions. The early sentences mention a questionable assumption (that the survey results are reliable) but do
not explain how the survey might have been flawed.
Then the response drifts to irrelevant matters—a
defense of the city park department, a prediction of
budget problems and the problem of pleasing city
residents.
Some statements even introduce unwarranted assumptions that are not part of the original argument
(e.g., “The residents will then begin to complain
about other issues” and “This assumption is that the
budget for another part of city maintenance or building will be tapped into”). Near the end, the response
does correctly note that city government should not
assume that residents want to use the river for recreation. Hence, the proposal to increase funding for
riverside recreational facilities may not be justified.
In summary, the language in this response is reasonably clear, but its examination of unstated assumptions remains limited and therefore the essay earns a
score of 3.

This statement looks like logical, but there are some

Second, as a reponse to the complaints from residents, the state plan to clean up the river. As a result,
the state expects that water sports will increase.
When you look at two sentences, the result is not appropriate for the cause.
Third, the last statement is the conclusion. However, even though residents rank water sports, the
city government might devote the budget to another

Whenever people argue that history is a worthless
subject or that there is nothing to be gained by just
“memorizing a bunch of stupid names and dates,” I
simply hold my tongue and smile to myself. What I’m
thinking is that, as cliche as it sounds, you do learn
a great deal from history (and woe to those who fail
to learn those lessons). It is remarkable to think of
the number of circumstances and situations in which
even the most rudimentary knowledge of history will
turn out to be invaluable. Take, for example, the issue
at hand here. Is it better for society to instill in future
leaders a sense of competition or cooperation? Those
who have not examined leaders throughout time and
across a number of fields might not have the ability
to provide a thorough and convincing answer to this
question, in spite of the fact that it is crucial to the
future functioning of our society. Looking closely at
the question of leadership and how it has worked in
the past, I would have to agree that the best way to
prepare young people for leadership roles is to instill
in them a sense of cooperation.
Let us look first at those leaders who have
defined themselves based on their competitiveness.
Although at first glance it may appear that a leader
must have a competitive edge in order to gain and
then maintain a leadership position, I will make two
points on this subject. First, the desire to compete

108

is an inherent part of human nature; that is, it is
not something that needs to be “instilled” in young
people. Is there anyone who does not compete in
some way or another every single day? You try to
do better than others in your school work or at the
office, or you just try to do better than yourself in
some way, to push yourself. When societies instill
competitiveness in their leaders, it only leads to
trouble. The most blatant example in this case is
Adolf Hitler, who took competition to the very
extreme, trying to prove that his race and his country
were superior to all. We do not, however, need to
look that far to find less extreme examples (i.e.,
Hitler is not the extreme example that disproves the
rule). The recent economic meltdown was caused
in no large part by the leaders of American banks
and financial institutions who were obsessed with
competing for the almighty dollar. Tiger Woods, the
ultimate competitor in recent golfing history and in
many ways a leader who brought the sport of golf
to an entirely new level, destroyed his personal life
(and perhaps his career ˉˉ still yet to be determined)
by his overreaching sense that he could accomplish
anything, whether winning majors or sleeping
with as many women as possible. His history of
competitiveness is well documented; his father
pushed him froma very early age to be the ultimate
competitor. It served him well in some respects, but
it also proved to be detrimental and ultimately quite
destructive.
Leaders who value cooperation, on the other
ahnd, have historically been less prone to these
overreaching, destructive tendencies. A good case in
point would be Abraham Lincoln. Now, I am sure at
this point you are thinking that Lincoln, who served
as President during the Civil War and who refused
to compromise with the South or allow secession,
could not possibly be my model of cooperation!
Think, however, of the way Lincoln structured his
Cabinet. He did not want a group of “yes men” who
would agree with every word he said, but instead
he picked people who were more likely to disagree
with his ideas. And he respected their input, which
allowed him to keep the government together in the
North during a very tumultuous period (to say the
least). My point in choosing the Lincoln example
is that competitiveness and conflict may play better
to the masses and be more likely to be recorded in
the history books, but it was his cooperative nature
that allowed him to govern effectively. Imagine if

the CEO of a large company were never able to
compromise and insisted that every single thing be
done in exactly her way. Very quickly she would
lose the very people that a company needs in order
to survive, people with new ideas, people ready to
make great advances. Without the ability to work
constructively with those who have conflicting ideas,
a leader will never be able to strike deals, reach
consensus, or keep an enterprise on track. Even if you
are the biggest fish in the pond, it is difficult to force
your will on others forever; eventually a bigger fish
comes along (or the smaller fish team up against you!).
In the end, it seems most critical for society to
instill in young people a sense of cooperation. In
part this is true because we seem to come by our
competitive side more naturally, but cooperation
is more often something we struggle to learn (just
think of kids on the playground). And although
competitive victory is more showy, more often than
not the real details of leadership come down to the
ability to work with other people, to compromise
and cooperate. Getting to be President of the United
States or the managing director of a corporation
might require you to win some battles, but once you
are there you will need diplomacy and people-skills.
Those can be difficult to learn, but if you do not have
them, you are likely to be a short-lived leader.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 6
This outstanding response earns a score of 6 for
presenting an insightful position on the issue and
supporting its analysis with compelling reasons and
persuasive examples. The response takes the insightful position that competition, though necessary to
some aspects of leadership, is less important for young
people to learn because it is inherent in the human
condition and can lead to dangerous excesses, whereas cooperation is more difficult to learn but more
essential. The response follows the task directions
by using counterarguments in the development of its
position. For example, the discussion of Lincoln explores conflicting sides of his Presidency (the “competition” of the Civil War and the “cooperation” within
his Cabinet). In fact, the response skillfully explores
the nuances of both cooperation and competition,
building its position of agreement with the prompt by
looking closely at many sides of both concepts. Additionally, the response demonstrates superior facility
with language. There are a few minor errors, mainly
typos, but in general the response demonstrates excel-

lent sentence variety and diction. This sentence is
typical of the quality of the writing throughout the
response: “My point in choosing the Lincoln example
is that competitiveness and conflict may play better
to the masses and be more likely to be recorded in
the history books, but it was his cooperative nature that allowed him to govern effectively.” In this
complex sentence, the writer makes skillful use of
parallel structure and subordination. Because of its
fluent writing and insightful development, then, this
response earns a score of 6.

Cooperation, the act of working as a group to
achieve a collective goal, is an important value for
young childern to learn. Another vital life lesson
children can learn is how to be competitive, which
is a mindset in which a person feels the need to
accomplish more than another person. Both are
necessary to become well rounded individuals, but
concerning preparing for a future in government,
industry or various other fields, a sense of cooperation
is much more important.
While not all children are overly competitive in
nature, every person has some level of competitive
drive inside them. This is a natural thing and is
perfectly normal. Unfortunately, if this competitive
nature is emphasized, the child will have problems
relating socially to other children, and subsequently,
will have issues interacting with adults later in life.
A fierce competitive drive will blind an individual,
causing them to not see situations where group effort
will be more greatly rewarded than an individual
effort. Take for instance the many teams of people
working for NASA. If the people that make up
these teams were all out to prove that they were
superior to others, our entire space program would be
jeapordized. One needs to look beyond the scope of
what is best on an individual level and learn to look
at what will most benefit a broad group of people.
This is where instilling a sense of cooperation in
young children is vital. Cooperation is taught at an
early age and must be emphasized throughout life to
fully embrace the concept.
In the world of sports a competitive drive is vital;
unfortunately, life is not a sports game that simply
leads to a winning or losing score. Life is far more
complex than this simple idea and there is no winner
or loser designation to accompany it. We all have to
work together to come to a conclusion that will assist

109

not just ourselves, but others and future generations.
In every scenario there will be individuals that have
brilliant ideas, but those ideas require other people to
build upon, perfect and impliment. Take for instance
Bill Gates; Bill Gates is responsible for the Microsoft
coorporation which he invented in his garage. His
competitive drive assisted in building his idea, but
it was the collaborative effort of many people that
helped propel his invention into the world known
product it is today. Without the cooperation of
others, his genius invention might never have made
it out of his garage.
It may be true that an individual can change the
world, but only so far as to say that an individual
can construct an idea that will inevitably change
the world. Once an idea is formulated, it then takes
a team of people working collectively towards a
common goal to make sure that the brillant, lifealtering idea makes it to furtuition. Without the
cooperation of many, an idea could simply remain
as a picture on a drawing board. It is because of this
possibility that instilling a cooperative demeanor in
children is much more important than developing a
competivie attitude. Competition is a natural thing
that will develop with or without encouragement but
the same cannot be said for a sense of cooperation.

When the generation of today matures, it is important for them to succeed and become the successful
leaders in government, industry and other fields.
There are many traits that leaders must possess, and
cooperation is one of these very important characters.
Nonetheless it is important for leaders to have a sense
of competition, so as to prevent themselves from being complacent with their position.
Cooperation is needed in order to be a functional
person in society, while still adhering to social
standards. Most leaders in society, did not start out
as such. A person cannot isolate themselves from
others with demeanor and attitude and expect to
become an executive. While there may be leaders
that have developed this ill attitude towards others,
they did not get there by being that way. A person
who is able to effectively cooperate with others, will
subsequently develop a nexus of supporters. Through
collaboration, people are able to develop their studies
further and better themselves.
However, it is still important for there to be
a sense of competition. Competition is the root
of motivation for most. It drives us to become
stronger, smarter, and to want more. Nonetheless,
the spirit of competition must also be reigned in,
and not be allowed to run wild. Competitiveness
can lead to abuse of power and distasteful actions,
which is quite the opposite of someone who displays
cooperativeness.
Some may argue that competition is not needed.
That those that are meant to be leaders will not
become complacent, because they have their own
internal drive to lead. If there was no competition,
there would be no world records. Michael Phelps
may not be a leader of government or industry, but he
is certainly educated on the technique of swimming,
and leader in his field. Would he be as good as he
is today if there was not competition? Would the
leaders of Microsoft have been motivated to create
Bing if there was no Google?

Cooperation helped many leaders get where they
are today, and will continue to do so in the future.
But leaders, as well as those that aspire to be one, all
need to have a sense of competition as well.

Compitition is not a evil it can inspire some
one to work better and looking to do better can be
considered good.But am afraid what fear here is that
when you compete with someone you set you limits
to that person.So once you do better than him/her
you tend to be relaxed and that is where when the
real evil creeps in.
With cooperation you have a goal and associated
effort to work for the same.Rather than individual
petty and competition to be better placed than
an friend it would be far more appreciable to keep
working for the common goal.That way even the
goal gets more defined at some level.So lets all drop

needed to be a good leader. If one is focused on
competition and ignores or refuse to work with others
then there would be problems for that leader. A

111

leader needs to be able to get along, cooperate and
know how to interact with others and allies. Treaties
and allies require cooperation. Trade agreements and
aid as well. A leader cannot achieve much alone.
Competition is also needed to encourage people
to be the best. If no one does there best to obtain a
goal how would a leader be chosen. What kind of
leader would that make? The best way for a society
to prepare its young is to instill a sense of both
competition and cooperation.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 2
This response earns a score of 2 for its seriously
limited development. There is a clear position on
the issue, as the writer argues that the “best way for
a society to prepare its young is to instill a sense
of both competition and cooperation.” However,
the writer provides few, if any, relevant reasons or
examples to support and develop this position. The
discussion of cooperation is supported only by very
generic assertions like the notion that “treaties
and allies require cooperation.” And there is even
less development in the discussion of competition.
In order to receive a higher score, the response
would need to provide more support for its position.
Language control in this response is adequate, but
the response earns a score of 2 because of its seriously
limited development.

Best way for a socity to prepare it’s young people for
leadership in government, industry, or other fields
is by instilling in them a sense of coopertion, not
competition. This statement is very true, whether
we mean leadership in government, industry, or any
other fields.
For leadership in government, industry, or other
fields some people argue that the best way for society
to prepare it’s young people is by instilling in them
a sense of cooperation. Other people argue that the
best way is through competition. It can be difficult
for many people to decide between these two choices.
There are many arguments that support both sides. I
fully agree that the best way is to instilling in them a
sense of cooperation, not competition.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 1
This response earns a score of 1 because it
demonstrates little evidence of the ability to develop

112

a position on the issue. Instead of developing a
position, the response simply repeats the language
of the prompt, adding some generic language that
could be applied to any Issue prompt. For example,
consider these sentences: “It can be difficult for many
people to decide between these two choices. There
are many arguments that support both sides.” This is
a totally generic analytical framework that has not
been filled in with any specific exploration related to
this prompt. The writer is clearly making an attempt
to respond to the prompt, and the final sentence
does seem to indicate a position on the issue. So the
response does not merit a score of 0. However, the
vast majority of the response is simply repetition of
language from the prompt and/or generic material.
Thus, it earns a score of 1.

Argument Task Essay Responses and
Reader Commentary
Argument Topic
The following is taken from a memo from the
advertising director of the Super Screen Movie
Production Company.
“According to a recent report from our marketing department, during the past year, fewer people
attended Super Screen-produced movies than in
any other year. And yet the percentage of positive
reviews by movie reviewers about specific Super
Screen movies actually increased during the past
year. Clearly, the contents of these reviews are not
reaching enough of our prospective viewers. Thus,
the problem lies not with the quality of our movies
but with the public’s lack of awareness that movies
of good quality are available. Super Screen should
therefore allocate a greater share of its budget next
year to reaching the public through advertising.”
Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered in order to decide
whether the recommendation and the argument on
which it is based are reasonable. Be sure to explain
how the answers to these questions would help to
evaluate the recommendation.

NOTE: All responses are reproduced exactly as
written, including errors, misspellings, etc., if any.
Essay Response – Score 6
The advertising director of the Super Screen Movie
production company believes that increasing the
amount of advertising the company does will increase the amount of people attending Super Screen
produced movies. He believes this because during
the past year fewer people than ever before attended
Super Screen produced movies, yet the percentage of
positive reviews about specific Super Screen produced
movies increased over the past year. Ostensibly the
extra advertising would tout the good reviews written about Super Screen movies. Before this plan is
implemented, however, Super Screen needs to address some questions about its possible flaws.
First of all, the company needs to ask what
the actual number of people attending its movies
as compared to the movies of other production
companies is. The number of people going to movies
may have been in universal decline. If this is the
case and more people are going to see Super Screen
Movies than the movies of any other production
company, advertising about how fun it is to go to the
movie theater may do more to boost Super Screen
viewership than advertising promoting its own good
reviews.
Secondly, the company needs to ask what the
actual original number of positive reviews was. If
Super Screen movies recieved 1% positive reviews
last year and this year they recieved 2% positive
reviews, getting that message to viewers is not going
to increase Super Screen attendence. Making better
movies would be much more likely to increase
attendence rates.
Finally, Super Screen needs to ask what the
relationship is between its viewers and the movie
reviewers cited in the memo. Using a survey
distributed to its target audience, Super Screen could
determine if movie reviews have an effect on their
audience’s decision to go see a movie, whether movie
reviewers tended to have the same taste as the target
audience and exactly whether or not movie reviews
are reaching the audience. Super Screen also needs
to consider how its movie choices have affected the
separate movie reviewer and audience populations.
If the studio has switched from making megablockbuster action movies to more nuanced dramas,
the general public may be less willing to go see their

movies even though movie critics prefer the dramas
to the action movies.
Finally the studio must ask whether the
percentage of positive reviews is really a relevant
way to measure the potential impact of movie
reviews. There are dozens of movie reviewers but
when deciding whether to not to go to a movie, the
general public will usually pick from among the 10
most popular movie reviews. These are the reviews
that will impress the public if they are included in
advertising. If the most popular movie reviewers
disliked Super Screen movies that a larger number
of small time film bloggers reviewed positively, Super
Screen needs to think of a new advertising strategy.
In conclusion, there are many questions Super
Screen needs to answer before using this advertising
director’s plan. They need to look carefully at actual
numbers, both of viewership and of positive reviews.
The also need to identify the relationship that
their target audience has with movie reviewers and
determine how their target audience feels about their
movies. Fianlly they need to take a nuanced look at
the movie reviews that they use in their advertising.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 6
This response clearly identifies aspects of the argument relevant to the assigned task and provides insightful, thoroughly developed analysis. Thus, it earns
a score of 6. The response is clearly on task, examining the questions that would need to be answered in
order to determine if the recommendation is reasonable. In each case, the writer perceptively explores
the nuances of the question, showing different ways
in which the answers to those questions might have
an impact on the recommendation. For example,
the first body paragraph looks at the issue of overall
movie attendance, exploring the possibility that Super Screen might actually be doing better than other
production companies. If that is the case, perhaps
Super Screen’s advertising is already effective, and
the proposed plan to increase advertising would not
have the intended effect. Throughout the response,
the analysis is detailed and cogent, and the organization of the response is logical both within paragraphs
and between paragraphs. In addition, although there
are a few misspelled words, the response demonstrates
facility with language, conveying ideas fluently and
precisely. Sentences like this one demonstrate the superior control of the conventions of standard written
English seen throughout this response: “If this is the

113

case and more people are going to see Super Screen
Movies than the movies of any other production
company, advertising about how fun it is to go to the
movie theater may do more to boost Super Screen
viewership than advertising promoting its own good
reviews.” Because of its fluent language and insightful
analysis, this response earns a score of 6.
Essay Response – Score 5
While the advertising director clearly aims at relitalizing his production company and ensuring that the
public is well informed about the movies which are
available, there are several basic flaws to his argument
. There remain some questions that need answering
before any steps can be taken with regard to advertising strategies for the Super Screen Movie Production
Company.
First among these questions is this; were ticket
sales of the entire movie industry down? This is an
essential question because it helps to pinpoint the
cause of the writer’s problem. If the industry as a
whole is undergoing poor revenues, then perhaps
the issue is not Super Screen’s advertising company
but rather the country’s economy. In times of
economic strife, it is only natural that people would
be less willing to spend money on luxuries such
as movie tickets. If this is the case, it might better
suit the production company to cut costs rather
than refunneling them into a different part of the
company.
Second, the advertising director should ask
himself this; what medium do the majority of his
most generous movie reviewers utilize? The writer
states that movie reviews were generally positive,
but where were these reviews located? On television,
newspapers, or the Internet? It is possible that the
medium used by the most positive reviewers of Super
Screen’s movies is one that is not utilized by most
of the company’s target audiences. If Super Screen
produces many family films, but most of the good
reviews are found in late night television shows, then
there is a good chance that the reviews are not going
to be seen by the target audience. If this is the case,
then the company would be better off conducting
research as to what medium is most likely to reach
their audiences.
One last question would be this; what advertising
is currently being used by the Super Screen company?
If the company advertises using only one medium,

114

such as in newspapers, perhaps the solution is not to
double the amount of newspaper space but to branch
out and try other forms of advertising. The writer
fails to mention exactly how the company currently
advertises their movies, and this absence detracts
from his argument.
In conclusion, the advertising director would
be better served by first answering these questions
and evaluating the resulting answers before pouring
millions of dollars into his solution. It is possible that
an alternative solution exists, perhaps one that will
not be as expensive nor as risky.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 5
This response earns a score of 5 because it presents
generally perceptive analysis and maintains facility
with language in spite of a few minor errors. The
writer clearly identifies aspects of the argument
relevant to the assigned task, looking at how the
various points raised might impact the marketing
director’s recommendation. However, the
development of each point is not as insightful as the
development seen in the sample 6 (see, for example,
the somewhat rudimentary paragraph about Super
Screen’s advertising media). In general, however, the
development is perceptive, as in the exploration of a
potential disconnect between the target audience and
the media used by the reviewers, so the response rises
above the adequate level. Language control in this
response is also at the 5 level, as seen in the effective
use of sentence variety and appropriate word choice.
Take, for example, this sentence, which demonstrates
effective control of subordination and complex
syntax: “If Super Screen produces many family films,
but most of the good reviews are found in late night
television shows, then there is a good chance that
the reviews are not going to be seen by the target
audience.” Because of its perceptive analysis and
strong control of language, then, this response earns a
score of 5.
Essay Response – Score 4
In order to decide whether or not the advertising director’s recommendation is reasonable there are a lot
more questions that need to be addressed. First of all
it is important to look at the bigger picture. Fundamentally, has anything changed about Super Screen?
Has new leadership come into the company? If so,
how has that changed business practices?

Leadership changes or other changes within the
company might have led Super Screen to choose to
make different types of movies this year than it has
in the past. It is important to determine whether or
not different movie subjects/topics have influenced
audiences. Many times there are discrepencies
between how a reviewer rates a movie and how an
audience rates a movie. It is important to determine
whether or not the audiences are pleased with the
products coming out of Super Screen, not just the
movie reviewers.
Another question to ask is whether or not
advertising has significantly changed over the past
year. Has there been any less advertising this year
than years before? If not, then again, the problem
probably does not lie in advertising alone. If there
have been some differences in the way movies were
advertised, it would be important to look at some
of those decisions and determine how they affected
movie audiences. Perhaps the right audiences were
not targeted for the right movies. If a childrens movie
was released and all the advertising went into adult
magazines, this would present an obvious problem.
In conclusion, it would not be a good idea to only
up the advertising budget next year in an attempt to
reach audiences. It is important to look at differences,
if any, throughout the whole company and then
determine the best course of action.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 4
This response does identify questions that need
to be answered in order to determine if the
recommendation is reasonable, and the development
of each point of analysis is adequate. Take, for
example, the discussion of how Super Screen might
have started making different types of movies this
year. The writer notes, “It is important to determine
whether or not different movie subjects/topics
have influenced audiences. Many times there are
discrepencies between how a reviewer rates a movie
and how an audience rates a movie.” This discussion
is certainly relevant, and it is developed enough
to make the point that positive reviews might not
lead to more viewers. But the response does not
demonstrate the perceptive analysis or the thorough
development required for a higher score. As with
the analysis, language control in this response is
adequate. There are some minor errors, but all the
writer’s points are presented with adequate clarity.
Because of its adequate analysis and language control,
this response earns a score of 4.

Essay Response – Score 3
There are a battery of questions that should be asked
when deciding whether or not the advertising director’s recommendation is reasonable. One of the most
prevalent being “How many people actually take into
account movie reviews when they are deciding which
movie to watch?” For, if no one reads movie reviews
before making these decisions, then the proposed
plan from the movie director may not guarantee
anything.
The second question would be this: “who exactly
is doing the movie reviews?” For instance, if there is
but one or two reviewers who are doing such work,
can we be sure that such a small sample would be
representative of our target market?
The director’s argument is not necessarily
fallacious. However, there is certain evidence that
would have to be put forward to consider his proposal
further. First of all, we need to know how our target
market takes movie reviews into account. And lastly,
we need to know who, and how many people, are
conducting the reviews. Only then, can we make a
maximally informed decision regarding the reviews.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 3
This response earns a score of 3 because of the
limited development of its critique. The points that
the writer makes are certainly relevant, and there
is some attempt made to analyze the impact on the
recommendation of the questions the writer raises.
However, the response provides little support for
each point. For example, the discussion of “who
exactly is doing the movie reviews” is supported
only by the fairly generic notion that the sample size
might be too small to be meaningful. This response
uses repetition instead of developing its analysis, as
seen in the final paragraph, which simply repeats the
points made earlier in the response. Language control
in this response is adequate, but it earns a score of 3
for limited development.
Essay Response – Score 2
It seems like the Super Screen Movie Production
Company has good quality movies. However, it did
not have enough viewers to see the movies. It is
probably because not many people are aware of their
movies that being showed. Their problem is how to
let people know that their movies are showing. The
Super Screen Movie Production Company need to
come up with different strategies to let people know

115

about their movies and has more advertisements
done. If the company does the following three
ideas, I think they are able to reach the number of
prospective viewers. One of them is advertise their
movies on television, second is to talk about their
new movies on radio, and third is to post poster of
their new movies every where that can catch people
attention. This will be able to bring their number of
viewers higher.
Television is a very popular electronic that no
one can live without. After a long working hours,
everyone watches television to relax such as the
News, movies, soap opera, and so on. If the Super
Screen Movie Production Company has their movie’s
advertisement during this hour, people will be able
to see and know that there is a good quality movie
around the corner. They will come and see the
movie.
Everyone has to go to work. They have to drive
in a car where they listen to their radio. This is the
best time for the Super Screen Movie Production
Company to talk about their new released movie.
This give people a chance to hear about their new
movie and decide whether to go see it or not.
Seeing a poster is worth more than a thousand
words. Many students do not like to look at a paper
with a lot of words, but if they see a poster with
picture, they will stop and look right away. This is
also helping the Super Screen Movie Production to
increase their viewers. Not only students, the adults
are the same. There are some people do not know
how to read, so seeing a poster of the new movie will
help them out a lot.
After discussing three different ways for the Super
Screen Movie Production Company to advertise
their movie to reach enough number of prospective
viewers, I believe that their movies will get many
more viewers to come see their movies. What easy
ways to let people know about their movies by
advertise them on television, talk about the movies
on radio, and put posters of their movies up everyone
that people can see.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 2
This response earns a score of 2 because it does not
present an examination based on logical analysis.
Instead, it agrees with the marketing director’s
argument and provides advice for how Super Screen
could best increase its advertising (“One of them

is advertise their movies on television, second is to
talk about their new movies on radio, and third is
to post poster of their new movies every where that
can catch people attention.”). There are some minor
errors in this response, but it does not demonstrate
the serious problems in language characteristic of a 2
(language control is more at the 3 level). Instead, this
response earns a 2 because it presents agreement and
advice instead of logical analysis.

Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 1
This incoherent response earns a score of 1. There
is some evidence of an attempt to respond to the
assigned topic (“It seems to be wrong things are
not exist about Super Screeb Movie Production
Company.”), but there is little or no evidence of
understanding the argument. There is also little or
no evidence of the ability to develop an organized
response. In addition, the response contains pervasive
errors that result in incoherence. For all these
reasons, then, the response earns a score of 1.
