IMPORTANT
The verbal and quantitative sections in the GRE General Test in this publication contain questions
written and administered prior to 1995. For this reason, some of the material covered in the questions
may be dated. For example, a question may refer to a rapidly changing technology in a way that was
correct in the 1980s and early 1990s, but not now. In addition, Educational Testing Service® ETS® has
revised and updated its standards and guidelines for test questions so some questions may not meet
current standards. Questions that do not meet current ETS standards, and would not appear in GRE
tests administered today, are marked with an asterisk (see pages 35 and 44).

Note to Test Takers: Keep this practice book until you receive your score report.
The book contains important information about scoring.

Purpose of the GRE
General Test
The GRE General Test is designed to help graduate
school admission committees and fellowship sponsors
assess the qualifications of applicants to their programs. It measures verbal, quantitative, and analytical
writing skills that you have acquired over a long
period of time.
Any accredited graduate or professional school, or
any department or division within a school, may
require or recommend that its applicants take the
GRE General Test. The scores can be used by admissions or fellowship panels to supplement undergraduate records and other qualifications for graduate
study. The scores provide common measures for
comparing the qualifications of applicants and aid in
the evaluation of grades and recommendations.

Structure of the GRE
General Test
The paper-based GRE General Test contains five
sections. In addition, one unidentified pretest section
may be included and this section can appear in any
position in the test after the analytical writing
section. Questions in the pretest section are being
pretested for possible use in future tests and answers
will not count toward your scores.
Total testing time is up to 33/4 hours. The directions at the beginning of each section specify the
total number of questions in the section and the time
allowed for the section. The analytical writing section
will always be first. The verbal and quantitative
sections may appear in any order, including an unidentified verbal or quantitative pretest section. Treat each
section presented during your test as if it counts.

the analytical writing section.

Scores Reported
Three scores are reported on the General Test:
1. a verbal score reported on a 200–800 score scale,
in 10-point increments,
2. a quantitative score reported on a 200–800 score
scale, in 10-point increments, and
3. an analytical writing score reported on a 0–6
score scale, in half-point increments.
If you answer no questions at all in a section (verbal,
quantitative, or analytical writing), that section will
be reported as a No Score (NS).
Descriptions of the analytical writing abilities
characteristic of particular score levels are available
in the interpretive leaflet enclosed with your score
report, in the Guide to the Use of GRE Scores, and on
the GRE Web site at www.gre.org.

Preparing for the GRE
General Test
Preparation for the test will depend on the amount of
time you have available and your personal preferences for how to prepare. At a minimum, before you
take the GRE General Test, you should know what to
expect from the test, including the administrative
procedures, types of questions and directions, the
approximate number of questions, and the amount of
time for each section.
The administrative procedures include registration, date, time, test center location, cost, scorereporting procedures, and availability of special
testing arrangements. You can find out about the

4

administrative procedures for the paper-based General Test online at www.gre.org, or by contacting
Educational Testing Service (see the GRE Information
and Registration Bulletin).
Before taking the practice General Test, it is
important to become familiar with the content of
each of the sections of the test. You can become
familiar with the verbal and quantitative sections by
reading about the skills the sections measure, how the
sections are scored, reviewing the strategies for each
of the question types, and reviewing the sample
questions with explanations. Determine which
strategies work best for you. Remember—you can do
very well on the test without answering every question in each section correctly.
Everyone—even the most practiced and confident
of writers—should spend some time preparing for the
analytical writing section before arriving at the test
center. It is important to review the skills measured,
how the section is scored, scoring guides and score
level descriptions, sample topics, scored sample essay
responses, and reader commentary.
To help you prepare for the analytical writing
section of the General Test, the GRE Program has
published the entire pool of topics from which your
test topics will be selected. You might find it helpful
to review the Issue and Argument pools. You can
view the published pools on the Web at
www.gre.org/pracmats.html or obtain a copy by
writing to GRE Program, PO Box 6000, Princeton,
NJ 08541-6000.
The topics in the analytical writing section relate
to a broad range of subjects—from the fine arts and
humanities to the social and physical sciences—but
no topic requires specific content knowledge. In fact,
each topic has been field-tested to ensure that it
possesses several important characteristics, including
the following:
• GRE test takers, regardless of their field of study
or special interests, understood the topic and
could easily discuss it.
• The topic elicited the kinds of complex thinking
and persuasive writing that university faculty
consider important for success in graduate
school.
• The responses were varied in content and in the
way the writers developed their ideas.

Test-Taking Strategies
IMPORTANT NOTE: Test-taking strategies
appropriate for the verbal and quantitative
sections of the paper-based General Test are
different from those that are appropriate for
taking the verbal and quantitative sections of the
computer-based General Test. Be sure to follow
the appropriate strategies for the testing format in
which you will be testing. Paper-based testing
strategies should not be used if you take the
computer-based test.

Verbal and Quantitative Sections
When taking a verbal or quantitative section of the
paper-based General Test, you are free, within any
section, to skip questions that you might have
difficulty answering and to come back to them later
during the time provided to work on that section.
You may also change the answer to any question you
recorded on the answer sheet by erasing it completely
and filling in the oval corresponding to your desired
answer for that question.
Each of your scores will be determined by the
number of questions for which you select the best
answer from the choices given. Questions for which
you mark no answer or more than one answer are not
counted in scoring. Nothing is subtracted from a
score if you answer a question incorrectly. Therefore,
to maximize your scores on the verbal and quantitative sections of the paper-based test, it is better for
you to answer each and every question and not to
leave any questions unanswered.
Work as rapidly as you can without being careless.
This includes checking frequently to make sure you
are marking your answers in the appropriate rows on
your answer sheet. Since no question carries greater
weight than any other, do not waste time pondering
individual questions you find extremely difficult or
unfamiliar.
You may want to work through a verbal or quantitative section of the General Test quite rapidly, first
answering only the questions about which you feel
confident, then going back and answering questions
that require more thought, and concluding with the
most difficult questions if there is time.
During the actual administration of the General

Test, you may work only on the section the test
center supervisor designates and only for the time
allowed. You may not go back to an earlier section of
the test after the supervisor announces, “Please stop
work” for that section. The supervisor is authorized to
dismiss you from the center for doing so. All answers
must be recorded on your answer sheet. Answers
recorded in your test booklet will not be counted.
Given the time constraints, you should avoid waiting
until the last five minutes of a test administration to
record answers on your answer sheet.
Some questions on the General Test have only
four response options (A through D). All GRE
answer sheets for the paper-based test contain response positions for five responses (A through E).
Therefore, if an E response is marked for a fouroption question, it will be ignored. An E response for
a four-option question is treated the same as no
response (omitted).

Analytical Writing Section
In the paper-based General Test, the topics in the
analytical writing section will be presented in the test
book and you will handwrite your essay responses on
the answer sheets provided. Make sure you use the
correct answer sheet for each task.
It is important to budget your time. Within the
45-minute time limit for the Issue task, you will need
to allow sufficient time to choose one of the two
topics, think about the issue you’ve chosen, plan a
response, and compose your essay. Within the 30minute time limit for the Argument task, you will
need to allow sufficient time to analyze the argument,
plan a critique, and compose your response. Although
GRE readers understand the time constraints under
which you write and will consider your response a
“first draft,” you still want it to be the best possible
example of your writing that you can produce under
the testing circumstances.
Save a few minutes at the end of each timed task
to check for obvious errors. Although an occasional
spelling or grammatical error will not affect your
score, severe and persistent errors will detract from
the overall effectiveness of your writing and thus
lower your score.
During the actual administration of the General
Test, you may work only on the particular writing
task the test center supervisor designates and only for
the time allowed. You may not go back to an earlier

5

section of the test after the supervisor announces,
“Please stop work,” for that task. The supervisor is
authorized to dismiss you from the center for doing so.
Following the analytical writing section, you will
have the opportunity to take a 10-minute break.

Review of the Verbal Section
Overview
The verbal section measures your ability to analyze
and evaluate written material and synthesize information obtained from it, to analyze relationships among
component parts of sentences, to recognize relationships between words and concepts, and to reason
with words in solving problems. There is a balance of
passages across different subject matter areas: humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences.
The verbal section contains the following question types:
• Antonyms
• Analogies
• Sentence Completions
• Reading Comprehension Questions

How the Verbal Section is Scored
Scoring of the verbal section of the paper-based
General Test is essentially a two-step process. First, a
raw score is computed. The raw score is the number
of questions for which the best answer choice was
given. The raw score is then converted to a scaled
score through a process known as equating. The
equating process accounts for differences in difficulty
among the different test editions; thus, a given scaled
score reflects approximately the same level of ability
regardless of the edition of the test that was taken.

Antonyms
Antonyms measure your
• vocabulary
• ability to reason from a given concept to its
opposite

*

6

The directions are presented as they appear on the actual test.

Directions*
Each question below consists of a word printed in
capital letters followed by five lettered words or
phrases. Choose the lettered word or phrase that is
most nearly opposite in meaning to the word in
capital letters. Since some of the questions require
you to distinguish fine shades of meaning, be sure
to consider all the choices before deciding which
one is best.
Sample Question
DIFFUSE:
(A) concentrate
(B) contend
(C) imply
(D) pretend
(E) rebel
Strategies for Answering
• Remember that antonyms are generally confined
to nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
• Look for the word that is most nearly opposite to
the given word.
• Try to define words precisely.
• Make up a sentence using the given word to
help establish its meaning.
• Look for possible second meanings before
choosing an answer.
• Use your knowledge of prefixes and suffixes to
help define words you don’t know.
Answer
The best answer is (A). Diffuse means to permit or
cause to spread out; only (A) presents an idea that is
in any way opposite to diffuse.

Analogies
Analogies measure your ability to recognize
• relationships among words and concepts they
represent
• parallel relationships
Directions*
In each of the following questions, a related pair of
words or phrases is followed by five lettered pairs of
words or phrases. Select the lettered pair that best
expresses a relationship similar to that expressed in
the original pair.

Sample Question

Sample Question

COLOR : SPECTRUM :
(A) tone : scale
(B) sound : waves
(C) verse : poem
(D) dimension : space
(E) cell : organism

Early ________ of hearing loss is ________ by the
fact that the other senses are able to compensate for
moderate amounts of loss, so that people frequently
do not know that their hearing is imperfect.
(A) discovery . . indicated
(B) development . . prevented
(C) detection . . complicated
(D) treatment . . facilitated
(E) incidence . . corrected

Strategies for Answering
• Establish a relationship between the given pair
before reading the answer choices.
• Consider relationships of kind, size, spatial
contiguity, or degree.
• Read all of the options. If more than one seems
correct, try to state the relationship more
precisely.
• Check to see that you haven’t overlooked a
possible second meaning for one of the words.
• Never decide on the best answer without reading
all of the answer choices.
Answer
The relationship between color and spectrum is not
merely that of part to whole, in which case (E) or
even (C) might be defended as correct. A spectrum is
made up of a progressive, graduated series of colors, as
a scale is of a progressive, graduated sequence of tones.
Thus, (A) is the correct answer choice. In this
instance, the best answer must be selected from a
group of fairly close choices.

Sentence Completions
Sentence completions measure your ability to recognize words or phrases that both logically and stylistically complete the meaning of a sentence.
Directions*
Each sentence below has one or two blanks, each
blank indicating that something has been omitted.
Beneath the sentence are five lettered words or sets
of words. Choose the word or set of words for each
blank that best fits the meaning of the sentence as
a whole.

Strategies for Answering
• Read the incomplete sentence carefully.
• Look for key words or phrases.
• Complete the blank(s) with your own words; see
if any options are like yours.
• Pay attention to grammatical cues.
• If there are two blanks, be sure that both parts of
your answer choice fit logically and stylistically
into the sentence.
• After choosing an answer, read the sentence
through again to see if it makes sense.
Answer
The statement that the other senses compensate
for partial loss of hearing indicates that the hearing
loss is not prevented or corrected; therefore, choices
(B) and (E) can be eliminated. Furthermore, the
ability to compensate for hearing loss certainly does
not facilitate the early treatment (D) or the early
discovery (A) of hearing loss. It is reasonable, however, that early detection of hearing loss is complicated
by the ability to compensate for it. The best answer
is (C).

Reading Comprehension Questions
Reading comprehension questions measure your
ability to
• read with understanding, insight, and
discrimination
• analyze a written passage from several
perspectives
Passages are taken from the humanities, social
sciences, and natural sciences.
Directions*

*

The directions are presented as they appear on the actual test.

The passage is followed by questions based on its
content. After reading the passage, choose the best
answer to each question. Answer all questions
following the passage on the basis of what is stated or
implied in the passage.

Picture-taking is a technique both for annexing the
objective world and for expressing the singular self.
Photographs depict objective realities that already exist,
though only the camera can disclose them. And they
depict an individual photographer’s temperament, discovering itself through the camera’s cropping of reality.
That is, photography has two antithetical ideals: in the
first, photography is about the world, and the photographer is a mere observer who counts for little; but in the
second, photography is the instrument of intrepid,
questing subjectivity and the photographer is all.
These conflicting ideals arise from a fundamental
uneasiness on the part of both photographers and viewers of photographs toward the aggressive component in
“taking” a picture. Accordingly, the ideal of a photographer as observer is attractive because it implicitly denies
that picture-taking is an aggressive act. The issue, of
course, is not so clear-cut. What photographers do cannot be characterized as simply predatory or as simply,
and essentially, benevolent. As a consequence, one ideal of
picture-taking or the other is always being rediscovered
and championed.
An important result of the coexistence of these two
ideals is a recurrent ambivalence toward photography’s
means. Whatever the claims that photography might
make to be a form of personal expression on a par with
painting, its originality is inextricably linked to the powers of a machine. The steady growth of these powers has
made possible the extraordinary informativeness and
imaginative formal beauty of many photographs, like
Harold Edgerton’s high-speed photographs of a bullet
hitting its target or of the swirls and eddies of a tennis
stroke. But as cameras become more sophisticated, more
automated, some photographers are tempted to disarm
themselves or to suggest that they are not really armed,
preferring to submit themselves to the limits imposed by
premodern camera technology because a cruder, less
high-powered machine is thought to give more interesting or emotive results, to leave more room for creative
accident. For example, it has been virtually a point of
honor for many photographers, including Walker Evans
and Cartier-Bresson, to refuse to use modern equipment.
These photographers have come to doubt the value of the
camera as an instrument of “fast seeing.” Cartier-Bresson,
in fact, claims that the modern camera may see too fast.
This ambivalence toward photographic means determines trends in taste. The cult of the future (of faster and
faster seeing) alternates over time with the wish to return
to a purer past — when images had a handmade quality.
This nostalgia for some pristine state of the photographic
enterprise is currently widespread and underlies the
present-day enthusiasm for daguerreotypes and the work
of forgotten nineteenth-century provincial photographers.
Photographers and viewers of photographs, it seems, need
periodically to resist their own knowingness.

According to the passage, the two antithetical ideals
of photography differ primarily in the
(A) value that each places on the beauty of the
finished product
(B) emphasis that each places on the emotional
impact of the finished product
(C) degree of technical knowledge that each requires
of the photographer
(D) extent of the power that each requires of the
photographer’s equipment
(E) way in which each defines the role of the
photographer
Strategies for Answering
• Read the passage closely, then proceed to the
questions.
or
Skim the passage, then reread the passage
closely as you answer the questions. You may
want to try it both ways with sample questions
to see what works best for you.
• Answer questions based on the content of the
passage.
• Separate main ideas from supporting ideas.
• Separate the author’s own ideas from information being presented.
• Ask yourself...
– What is this about?
– What are the key points?
– How does the main idea relate to other ideas
in the passage?
– What words define relationships among ideas?
Answer
The best answer to this question is (E). Photography’s
two ideals are presented in lines 7–11. The main
emphasis in the description of these two ideals is on
the relationship of the photographer to the enterprise
of photography, with the photographer described in
the one as a passive observer and in the other as an
active questioner. (E) identifies this key feature in the
description of the two ideals—the way in which each
ideal conceives or defines the role of the photographer in photography. (A) through (D) present aspects
of photography that are mentioned in the passage,
but none of these choices represents a primary
difference between the two ideals of photography.

Review of the Quantitative
Section
Overview
The quantitative section measures your basic mathematical skills, your understanding of elementary
mathematical concepts, and your ability to reason
quantitatively and solve problems in a quantitative
setting. There is a balance of questions requiring
arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and data analysis.
These are content areas usually studied in high
school.
Arithmetic
Questions may involve arithmetic operations, powers,
operations on radical expressions, estimation, percent, absolute value, properties of integers (e.g.,
divisibility, factoring, prime numbers, odd and even
integers), and the number line.
Algebra
Questions may involve rules of exponents, factoring
and simplifying algebraic expressions, understanding
concepts of relations and functions, equations and
inequalities, solving linear and quadratic equations
and inequalities, solving simultaneous equations,
setting up equations to solve word problems, coordinate geometry, including slope, intercepts, and graphs
of equations and inequalities, and applying basic
algebra skills to solve problems.
Geometry
Questions may involve parallel lines, circles, triangles
(including isosceles, equilateral, and 30°–60°–90°
triangles), rectangles, other polygons, area, perimeter,
volume, the Pythagorean Theorem, and angle
measure in degrees. The ability to construct proofs is
not measured.
Data Analysis
Questions may involve elementary probability, basic
descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range,
standard deviation, percentiles), and interpretation of
data in graphs and tables (line graphs, bar graphs,
circle graphs, frequency distributions).

Math Symbols and Other Information
The following information applies to all questions in
the quantitative sections.
• These common math symbols may be used:
x < y (x is less than y)
x‫ ס‬y (x is not equal to y)
(the nonnegative square root of x,
where x ≥ 0)
|x|
(the absolute value of x, where x is a
real number)
n!
(n factorial: the product of the first n
positive integers)
m ࿣ n (line m is parallel to line n)
m n (line m is perpendicular to line n)
A
B

C

(∠ABC is a right angle)

• Numbers: all numbers used are real numbers.
• Figures:
– the positions of points, angles, regions, etc.,
can be assumed to be in the order shown;
angle measures are positive
– a line shown as straight can be assumed to be
straight
– figures lie in a plane unless otherwise
indicated
– do not assume figures are drawn to scale
unless stated
It is important to familiarize yourself with the basic
mathematical concepts in the GRE General Test.
The publication Math Review is available as a download on the GRE Web site at www.gre.org/
pracmats.html and provides detailed information on
the content of the quantitative section.
The quantitative section contains the following
question types:
• Quantitative Comparison Questions
• Problem Solving – Discrete Quantitative
Questions
• Problem Solving – Data Interpretation
Questions
Questions emphasize understanding basic principles
and reasoning within the context of given
information.

How the Quantitative Section is
Scored
The quantitative section of the paper-based General
Test is scored the same way as the verbal section.
First, a raw score is computed. The raw score is the
number of questions for which the best answer choice
was given. The raw score is then converted to a
scaled score through a process known as equating.
The equating process accounts for differences in
difficulty among the different test editions; thus a
given scaled score reflects approximately the same
level of ability regardless of the edition of the test
that was taken.

Quantitative Comparison Questions
Quantitative comparison questions measure your
ability to:
• reason quickly and accurately about the relative
sizes of two quantities
• perceive that not enough information is provided to make such a decision
Directions*
Each of the sample questions consists of two quantities, one in Column A and one in Column B. There
may be additional information, centered above the
two columns, that concerns one or both of the
quantities. A symbol that appears in both columns
represents the same thing in Column A as it does in
Column B.
You are to compare the quantity in Column A
with the quantity in Column B and decide whether:
(A) The quantity in Column A is greater.
(B) The quantity in Column B is greater.
(C) The two quantities are equal.
(D) The relationship cannot be determined from the
information given.
Note: Since there are only four choices, NEVER
MARK (E).**
Sample Questions
Column A
1.
2.

Column B

9.8
(‫4)6מ‬

(‫5)6מ‬

Strategies for Answering
• Avoid extensive computation if possible. Try to
estimate the answer.
• Consider all kinds of numbers before deciding. If
under some conditions Column A is greater
than Column B and for others, Column B is
greater than Column A, choose “the relationship cannot be determined from the information
given,” and go to the next question.
• Geometric figures may not be drawn to scale.
Comparisons should be made based on the given
information, together with your knowledge of
mathematics, rather than on exact appearance.
Answer to Question 1
denotes 10, the positive square root of 100. (For
any positive number x, denotes the positive number
whose square is x.) Since 10 is greater than 9.8, the
best answer is (B). It is important not to confuse this
question with a comparison of 9.8 and x where
x2‫ .001ס‬The latter comparison would yield (D) as
the correct answer because x2‫ 001ס‬implies that
either x‫ 01ס‬or x‫ ,01מס‬and there would be no way
to determine which value x would actually have.
Answer to Question 2
Since (‫ 4)6מ‬is the product of four negative factors,
and the product of an even number of negative
numbers is positive, (‫ 4)6מ‬is positive. Since the
product of an odd number of negative numbers
is negative, (‫ 5)6מ‬is negative. Therefore, (‫4)6מ‬
is greater than (‫ 5)6מ‬since any positive number
is greater than any negative number. The best
answer is (A). It is not necessary to calculate that
(‫ 692,1ס 4)6מ‬and that (‫ 677,7מס 5)6מ‬in order to
make the comparison.

Problem Solving – Discrete
Quantitative Questions
Discrete quantitative questions measure
• basic mathematical knowledge
• your ability to read, understand, and solve a
problem that involves either an actual or an
abstract situation
Directions*
Each of the following questions has five answer
choices. For each of these questions, select the best of
the answer choices given.

*

10

**

The directions are presented as they appear on the actual test.
The answer sheet contains five choices for the verbal and quantitative sections.

Sample Question
When walking, a certain person takes 16 complete
steps in 10 seconds. At this rate, how many complete
steps does the person take in 72 seconds?
(A) 45
(B) 78
(C) 86
(D) 90
(E) 115
Strategies for Answering
• Determine what is given and what is being
asked.
• Scan all answer choices before answering a
question.
• When approximation is required, scan
answer choices to determine the degree of
approximation.
• Avoid long computations. Use reasoning
instead, when possible.
Answer
72 seconds represents 7 ten-second intervals plus 2/10
of such an interval. Therefore, the person who takes
16 steps in 10 seconds will take (7.2)(16) steps in 72
seconds.
(7.2)(16) ‫)61()2.0( ם )61()7( ס‬
‫2.3 ם 211 ס‬
‫2.511 ס‬
Since the question asks for the number of complete steps, the best answer choice is (E).

Problem Solving – Data
Interpretation Questions
Data interpretation questions measure your ability
• to synthesize information and select appropriate
data for answering a question
• to determine that sufficient information for
answering a question is not provided
The data interpretation questions usually appear in
sets and are based on data presented in tables, graphs,
or other diagrams.
Directions*
Each of the following questions has five answer
choices. For each of these questions, select the best of
the answer choices given.

Review of the Analytical
Writing Section
Overview
The analytical writing section tests your critical
thinking and analytical writing skills. It assesses your
ability to articulate and support complex ideas,
analyze an argument, and sustain a focused and
coherent discussion. It does not assess specific content knowledge.
The analytical writing section consists of two
separately-timed analytical writing tasks:
• a 45-minute “Present Your Perspective on an
Issue” task
• a 30-minute “Analyze an Argument” task
You will be given a choice between two Issue topics.
Each states an opinion on an issue of broad interest
and asks you to discuss the issue from any
perspective(s) you wish, as long as you provide
relevant reasons and examples to explain and support
your views.
You will not have a choice of Argument topics.
The Argument task presents a different challenge
from that of the Issue task: it requires you to critique
a given argument by discussing how well reasoned
you find it. You will need to consider the logical
soundness of the argument rather than to agree or
disagree with the position it presents.
The two tasks are complementary in that one
requires you to construct your own argument by
taking a position and providing evidence supporting
your views on the issue, whereas the other requires
you to critique someone else’s argument by assessing
its claims and evaluating the evidence it provides.

How the Analytical Writing Section
is Scored
Each response is holistically scored on a 6-point scale
according to the criteria published in the GRE
analytical writing scoring guides (see Appendix A on
pages 51–52). Holistic scoring means that each
response is judged as a whole: readers do not separate
the response into component parts and award a
certain number of points for a particular criterion or
element such as ideas, organization, sentence structure, or language. Instead, readers assign scores based
on the overall quality of the response, considering all
of its characteristics in an integrated way. Excellent

12

organization or poor organization, for example, will
be part of the readers’ overall impression of the
response and will therefore contribute to the score,
but organization, as a distinct feature, has no specific
weight.
In general, GRE readers are college and university
faculty experienced in teaching courses in which
writing and critical thinking skills are important. All
GRE readers have undergone careful training, passed
stringent GRE qualifying tests, and demonstrated
that they are able to maintain scoring accuracy.
To ensure fairness and objectivity in scoring
• responses are randomly distributed to the readers
• all identifying information about the test takers
is concealed from the readers
• each response is scored by two readers
• readers do not know what other scores a response may have received
• the scoring procedure requires that each response receive identical or adjacent scores from
two readers; any other score combination is
adjudicated by a third GRE reader
The scores given for the two tasks are then averaged
for a final reported score. The score level descriptions, presented in Appendix A on page 53, provide
information on how to interpret the total score on
the analytical writing section. The primary emphasis
in scoring the analytical writing section is on critical
thinking and analytical writing skills.
Note: The GRE Program is investigating the use of
e-rater, ETS's ground breaking automated scoring
system, as part of the scoring process for the analytical writing section. If e-rater is incorporated into the
scoring process during the 2004-05 testing year,
information will be available on the GRE Web site at
www.gre.org.
Your essay responses on the analytical writing
section will be reviewed by ETS essay-similaritydetection software and by experienced essay readers
during the scoring process. In light of the high value
placed on independent intellectual activity within
United States graduate schools and universities, ETS
reserves the right to cancel test scores of any test
taker when there is substantial evidence that an essay
response includes, but is not limited to, any of the
following:
• text that is substantially similar to that found on
one or more other GRE essay responses;

• quoting or paraphrasing, without attribution,
language, or ideas that appear in published or
unpublished sources;
• unacknowledged use of work that has been
produced through collaboration with others
without citation of the contribution of others;
• essays that are submitted as work of the examinee when the ideas or words have, in fact,
been borrowed from elsewhere or prepared by
another person.
When one or more of these circumstances occurs,
your essay text, in ETS’s professional judgement, does
not reflect the independent, analytical writing skills
that this test seeks to measure. Therefore, ETS must
cancel the essay score as invalid and cannot report
the GRE General Test scores of which the essay score
is an indispensable part.
Test takers whose scores are canceled will forfeit
their test fees and must pay to take the entire GRE
General Test again at a future administration. No
record of score cancellations, or the reason for
cancellation, will appear on their future score reports
sent to colleges and universities.

Present Your Perspective on an
Issue Task
The “Present Your Perspective on an Issue” task
assesses your ability to think critically about a topic of
general interest and to clearly express your thoughts
about it in writing. Each topic, presented in quotation marks, makes a claim about an issue that test
takers can discuss from various perspectives and apply
to many different situations or conditions. Your task is
to present a compelling case for your own position on
the issue. Be sure to read the claim carefully and
think about it from several points of view, considering the complexity of ideas associated with those
perspectives. Then, make notes about the position
you want to develop and list the main reasons and
examples that you could use to support that position.
The Issue task allows considerable latitude in the
way you respond to the claim. Although it is important that you address the central issue, you are free to
take any approach you wish. For example, you might
• agree absolutely with the claim, disagree completely, or agree with some parts and not others
• question the assumptions the statement seems to
be making
• qualify any of its terms, especially if the way you
define or apply a term is important to developing your perspective on the issue

• point out why the claim is valid in some situations but not in others
• evaluate points of view that contrast with your
own perspective
• develop your position with reasons that are
supported by several relevant examples or by a
single extended example
The GRE readers scoring your response are not
looking for a “right” answer—in fact, there is no
correct position to take. Instead, the readers are
evaluating the skill with which you articulate and
develop an argument to support your position on the
issue.
Understanding the Context for Writing:
Purpose and Audience
The Issue task is an exercise in critical thinking and
persuasive writing. The purpose of this task is to
determine how well you can develop a compelling
argument supporting your own perspective on an
issue and to effectively communicate that argument
in writing to an academic audience. Your audience
consists of college and university faculty who are
trained as GRE readers to apply the scoring criteria
identified in the scoring guide for “Present Your
Perspective on an Issue” (see page 51).
To get a clearer idea of how GRE readers apply the
Issue scoring criteria to actual responses, you should
review scored sample Issue essay responses and
readers’ commentaries. The sample responses, particularly at the 5 and 6 score levels, will show you a
variety of successful strategies for organizing, developing, and communicating a persuasive argument. The
readers’ commentaries discuss specific aspects of
analysis and writing, such as the use of examples,
development and support, organization, language
fluency, and word choice. For each response, the
commentary points out aspects that are particularly
persuasive as well as any that detract from the overall
effectiveness of the essay.
Preparing for the Issue Task
Because the Issue task is meant to assess the persuasive writing skills that you have developed throughout your education, it has been designed neither to
require any particular course of study nor to advantage students with a particular type of training.
Many college textbooks on composition offer
advice on persuasive writing that you might find
useful, but even this advice might be more technical

13

and specialized than you need for the Issue task. You
will not be expected to know specific critical thinking or writing terms or strategies; instead, you should
be able to use reasons, evidence, and examples to
support your position on an issue. Suppose, for
instance, that an Issue topic asks you to consider
whether it is important for government to provide
financial support for art museums. If your position is
that government should fund art museums, you might
support your position by discussing the reasons art is
important and explain that museums are public
places where art is available to anyone. On the other
hand, if your position is that government should not
support museums, you might point out that, given
limited governmental funds, art museums are not as
deserving of governmental funding as are other, more
socially important, institutions. Or, if you are in favor
of government funding for art museums only under
certain conditions, you might focus on the artistic
criteria, cultural concerns, or political conditions that
you think should determine how—or whether—art
museums receive government funds. It is not your
position that matters so much as the critical thinking
skills you display in developing your position.
An excellent way to prepare for the Issue task is to
practice writing on some of the published topics.
There is no “best” approach: some people prefer to
start practicing without regard to the 45-minute time
limit; others prefer to take a “timed test” first and
practice within the time limit. No matter which
approach you take when you practice the Issue task,
you should review the task directions, then
• carefully read the claim made in the topic and
make sure you understand the issue involved; if
it seems unclear, discuss it with a friend or
teacher
• think about the issue in relation to your own
ideas and experiences, to events you have read
about or observed, and to people you have
known; this is the knowledge base from which
you will develop compelling reasons and examples in your argument that reinforce, negate,
or qualify the claim in some way
• decide what position on the issue you want to
take and defend—remember you are free to
agree or disagree completely or to agree with
some parts or some applications but not others
• decide what compelling evidence (reasons and
examples) you can use to support your position

14

Remember that this is a task in critical thinking and
persuasive writing. Therefore, you might find it
helpful to explore the complexity of a claim in one of
the topics by asking yourself the following questions:
• What, precisely, is the central issue?
• Do I agree with all or with any part of the claim?
Why or why not?
• Does the claim make certain assumptions? If so,
are they reasonable?
• Is the claim valid only under certain conditions?
If so, what are they?
• Do I need to explain how I interpret certain
terms or concepts used in the claim?
• If I take a certain position on the issue, what
reasons support my position?
• What examples—either real or hypothetical—
could I use to illustrate those reasons and
advance my point of view? Which examples are
most compelling?
Once you have decided on a position to defend,
consider the perspective of others who might not
agree with your position. Ask yourself:
• What reasons might someone use to refute or
undermine my position?
• How should I acknowledge or defend against
those views in my essay?
To plan your response, you might want to summarize
your position and make brief notes about how you
will support the position you’re going to take. When
you’ve done this, look over your notes and decide
how you will organize your response. Then write a
response developing your position on the issue. Even
if you don’t write a full response, you should find it
helpful to practice with a few of the Issue topics and
to sketch out your possible responses. After you
have practiced with some of the topics, try writing
responses to some of the topics within the 45-minute
time limit so that you have a good idea of how to use
your time in the actual test.
Next, compare your response to the scoring guide.
Focus on seeing how your paper meets or misses the
performance standards and what you therefore need
to do in order to improve.
Deciding Which Issue Topic to Choose
Remember that the General Test will contain two
Issue topics from the published pool; you must choose
one of these two. Because the 45-minute timing
begins when you first see the two topics, you should

not spend too much time making a decision. Instead,
try to choose fairly quickly the issue that you feel
better prepared to discuss.
Before making a choice, read each topic carefully.
Then decide on which topic you could develop a
more effective and well-reasoned argument. In
making this decision, you might ask yourself:
• Which topic do I find more interesting or
engaging?
• Which topic more closely relates to my own
academic studies or other experiences?
• On which topic can I more clearly explain and
defend my perspective?
• On which topic can I more readily think of
strong reasons and examples to support my
position?
Your answers to these questions should help you make
your choice.
The Form of Your Response
You are free to organize and develop your response in
any way that you think will effectively communicate
your ideas about the issue. Your response may, but
need not, incorporate particular writing strategies
learned in English composition or writing-intensive
college courses. GRE readers will not be looking for a
particular developmental strategy or mode of writing;
in fact, when GRE readers are trained, they review
hundreds of Issue responses that, although highly
diverse in content and form, display similar levels of
critical thinking and persuasive writing. Readers will
see, for example, some Issue responses at the 6 score
level that begin by briefly summarizing the writer’s
position on the issue and then explicitly announcing
the main points to be argued. They will see others
that lead into the writer’s position by making a
prediction, asking a series of questions, describing a
scenario, or defining critical terms in the quotation.
The readers know that a writer can earn a high score
by giving multiple examples or by presenting a single,
extended example. Look at the sample Issue responses, particularly at the 5 and 6 score levels, to see
how other writers have successfully developed and
organized their arguments.
You should use as many or as few paragraphs as
you consider appropriate for your argument—for
example, you will probably need to create a new
paragraph whenever your discussion shifts to a new
cluster of ideas. What matters is not the number of
examples, the number of paragraphs, or the form your

argument takes but, rather, the cogency of your ideas
about the issue and the clarity and skill with which
you communicate those ideas to academic readers.
Directions*
Present your perspective on the issue below, using
relevant reasons and/or examples to support your
views.
Sample Topic
“In our time, specialists of all kinds are highly overrated. We need more generalists—people who can
provide broad perspectives.”
Strategies for this Topic
This claim raises several related questions: What does
it mean to be a generalist or a specialist, and what
value do they have for society? Does society actually
need more generalists, and are specialists, in fact,
“highly overrated”?
There are several basic positions you could take
on this issue: Yes, society needs more generalists and
places too high a value on specialists. No, the opposite is true. Or, it depends on various factors. Or, both
groups are important in today’s culture; neither is
overvalued. Your analysis might draw examples from
a particular society or country, from one or more areas
of society, or from various situations. It might focus
on the role of generalists and specialists in relation to
communications, transportation, politics, information, or technology. Any of these approaches is valid,
as long as you use relevant reasons and examples to
support your position.
Before you stake out a position, take a few moments to reread the claim. To analyze it, consider
questions such as these:
• What are the main differences between specialists and generalists? What are the strong points
of each?
• Do these differences always hold in various
professions or situations? Could there be some
specialists, for example, who also need to have
very broad knowledge and general abilities to
perform their work well?
• How do generalists and specialists function in
your field?
• What value do you think society places on
specialists and generalists? Are specialists
overvalued in some situations, and not in
others?

15

• Does society really need more generalists than it
has? If so, what needs would they serve?
Now you can organize your thoughts into two groups:
• Reasons and examples to support the claim
• Reasons and examples to support an opposing
point of view
If you find one view clearly more persuasive than the
other, consider developing an argument from that
perspective. As you build your argument, keep in
mind the other points, which you could argue
against.
If both groups have compelling points, consider
developing a position supporting, not the stated
claim, but a more limited or more complex claim.
Then you can use reasons and examples from both
sides to justify your position.

In this era of rapid social and technological change
leading to increasing life complexity and psychological displacement, both positive and negative effects
among persons in Western society call for a balance
in which there are both specialists and generalists.
Specialists are necessary in order to allow society
as a whole to properly and usefully assimilate the
masses of new information and knowledge that have
come out of research and have been widely disseminated through mass global media. As the head of
Pharmacology at my university once said (and I
paraphrase): “I can only research what I do because
there are so many who have come before me to
whom I can turn for basic knowledge. It is only
because of each of the narrowly focussed individuals
at each step that a full and true understanding of the
complexities of life can be had. Each person can only
hold enough knowledge to add one small rung to the
ladder, but together we can climb to the moon.” This
illustrates the point that our societies level of knowledge and technology is at a stage in which there
simply must be specialists in order for our society to
take advantage of the information available to us.
Simply put, without specialists, our society would
find itself bogged down in the Sargasso sea of information overload. While it was fine for early physicists
to learn and understand the few laws and ideas that
existed during their times, now, no one individual
can possibly digest and assimilate all of the knowledge in any given area.

On the other hand, Over specialization means
narrow focii in which people can lose the larger
picture.No one can hope to understand the human
body by only inspecting one’s own toe-nails. What we
learn from a narrow focus may be internally logically
coherent but may be irrelevant or fallacious within
the framework of a broader perspective. Further, if we
inspect only our toe-nails, we may conclude that the
whole body is hard and white. Useful conclusions and
thus perhaps useful inventions must come by sharing
among specialists. Simply throwing out various
discovieries means we have a pile of useless discoveries, it is only when one can make with them a mosaic
that we can see that they may form a picture.
Not only may over-specialization be dangerous in
terms of the truth, purity and cohesion of knowledge,
but it can also serve to drown moral or universall issues.
Generalists and only generalists can see a broad enough
picture to realize and introduce to the world the
problems of the environment. With specialization, each
person focusses on their research and their goals. Thus,
industrialization, expansion, and new technologies are
driven ahead. Meanwhile no individual can see the
wholisitc view of our global existence in which true
advancement may mean stifling individual specialists
for the greater good of all.
Finally, over-specialization in a people’s daily lives
and jobs has meant personal and psychological
compartmentalization. People are forced into pigeon
holes early in life (at least by university) and must
conciously attempt to consume external forms of
stimuli and information in order not to be lost in
their small and isolated universe. Not only does this
make for narrowly focussed and generally pooprlyeducated individuals, but it guarantees a sense of loss
of community, often followed by a feeling of psychological displacement and personal dissatisfaction.
Without generalists, society becomes inwardlooking and eventually inefficient. Without a society
that recongnizes the impotance of braod-mindedness
and fora for sharing generalities, individuals become
isolated. Thus, while our form of society necessitates
specialists, generalists are equally important. Specialists drive us forward in a series of thrusts while
generalists make sure we are still on the jousting field
and know what the stakes are.

This is an outstanding analysis of the issue—insightful, well reasoned, and highly effective in its use of
language. The introductory paragraph announces the
writer’s position on the issue and provides the context within which the writer will develop that
position: “In this era of rapid social and technological
change leading to increasing life complexity and
psychological displacement . . . .”
The argument itself has two parts. The first part
presents a compelling case for specialization, primarily in the field of medicine. The second part presents
an equally compelling, well-organized case against
overspecialization based on three main reasons:
• logical (narrowly trained specialists often fail to
understand the whole)
• moral (usually generalists understand what is
needed for “the greater good”)
• personal (specializing/pigeonholing too early can
be psychologically damaging)
The argument’s careful line of reasoning is further
strengthened by the skillful use of expert testimony
(quotation from a prominent medical researcher) and
vivid metaphor (to inspect only one’s toenails is to
ignore the whole body).
It is not only the reasoning that distinguishes this
response. The language is precise and often figurative
(“bogged down in a Sargasso sea of information
overload,” “a pile of useless discoveries,” and “specialists drive us forward in a series of thrusts, while
generalists make sure we are still on the jousting
field”). The reader is constantly guided through the
argument by transitional phrases and ideas that help
organize the ideas and move the argument forward.
This is an exceptionally fine response to the topic.

Specialists are not overrated today. More generalists
may be needed, but not to overshadow the specialists.
Generalists can provide a great deal of information
on many topics of interest with a broad range of
ideas. People who look at the overall view of things
can help with some of the large problems our society
faces today. But specialists are necessary to gain a
better understanding of more in depth methods to
solve problems or fixing things.
One good example of why specialists are not
overrated is in the medical field. Doctors are necessary for people to live healthy lives. When a person is
sick, he may go to a general practitioner to find out

the cause of his problems. Usually, this kind of
“generalized” doctor can help most ailments with
simple and effective treatments. Sometimes, though,
a sickness may go beyond a family doctor’s knowledge
or the prescribed treatments don’t work the way they
should. When a sickness progresses or becomes
diagnosed as a disease that requires more care than a
family doctor can provide, he may be referred to a
specialist. For instance, a person with constant
breathing problems that require hospitalization may
be suggested to visit an asthma specialist. Since a
family doctor has a great deal of knowledge of medicine, he can decide when his methods are not effective and the patient needs to see someone who knows
more about the specific problem; someone who
knows how it begins, progresses, and specified treatments. This is an excellent example of how a
generalied person may not be equipped enough to
handle something as well as a specialized one can.
Another example of a specialist who is needed
instead of a generalist involves teaching. In grammar
school, children learn all the basic principles of
reading, writing, and arithematic. But as children get
older and progress in school, they gain a better
understanding of the language and mathematical
processes. As the years in school increase, they need
to learn more and more specifics and details about
various subjects. They start out by learning basic
math concepts such as addition, subtraction, division,
and multiplication. A few years later, they are ready
to begin algebraic concepts, geometry, and calculus.
They are also ready to learn more advanced vocabulary, the principles of how all life is composed and
how it functions. One teacher or professor can not
provide as much in depth discussion on all of these
topics as well as one who has learned the specifics
and studied mainly to know everything that is
currently known about one of these subjects. Generalized teachers are required to begin molding students
at a very early age so they can get ready for the future
ahead of them in gaining more facts about the basic
subjects and finding out new facts on the old ones.
These are only two examples of why specialists are
not highly overrated and more generalists are not
necessary to the point of overshadowing them.
Generalists are needed to give the public a broad
understanding of some things. But , specialists are
important to help maintain the status, health, and
safety of our society. Specialists are very necessary.

Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 5
This writer presents a well-developed analysis of the
complexities of the issue by discussing the need for
both the generalist and the specialist.
The argument is rooted in two extended examples, both well chosen. The first (paragraph 2)
begins with a discussion of the necessity for medical
generalists (the general practitioner) as well as
specialists and moves into an example within the
example (breathing problems and the need for an
asthma specialist). This extension from the general to
the specific characterizes the example in the next
paragraph as well. There, the discussion centers on
education from elementary to high school, from basic
arithmetic to calculus.
The smooth development is aided by the use of
appropriate transitions: “but,” “usually,” and “for
instance,” among others. The essay ends by revisiting
the writer’s thesis.
While the writer handles language and syntax
well, several lapses in clarity keep this otherwise wellargued response out of the 6 category. The problems
vary from the lack of a pronoun referent (“When a
sickness progresses or becomes diagnosed, . . . he may
be referred to a specialist”) to an error in parallel
structure (“how it begins, progresses and specified
treatments”), to loose syntax and imprecise language
(“Generalized teachers are required to begin molding
students at a very early age so they can get ready for
the future ahead of them in gaining more facts about
the basic subjects.”)

Specialists are just what their name says: people who
specialize in one part of a very general scheme of
things. A person can’t know everything there is to
know about everything. This is why specialists are
helpful. You can take one general concept and divide
it up three ways and have three fully developed
different concepts instead of one general concept that
no one really knows about. Isn’t it better to really
know something well, than to know everything
half-way.
Take a special ed teacher compared to a general ed
teacher. The general ed teacher knows how to deal
with most students. She knows how to teach a
subject to a student that is on a normal level. But
what would happen to the child in the back of the
room with dyslexia? She would be so lost in that
general ed classroom that she would not only not

18

learn, but be frustrated and quite possibly, have low
self-esteem and hate school. If there is a special ed
teacher there who specializes in children with
learning disabilities, she can teach the general ed
teacher how to cope with this student as well as
modify the curriculum so that the student can learn
along with the others. The special ed teacher can also
take that child for a few hours each day and work
with her on her reading difficulty one-on-one, which
a general ed teacher never would have time to do.
A general ed teacher can’t know what a special ed
teacher knows and a special ed teacher can’t know
what a general ed teacher knows. But the two of
them working together and specializing in their own
things can really get a lot more accomplished. The
special ed teacher is also trained to work on the
child’s self-esteem, which has a big part in how
successful this child will be. Every child in the
United States of America has the right to an equal
education. How can a child with a learning disability
receive the same equal education as a general ed
student if there was no specialist there to help both
teacher and child?
Another thing to consider is how a committee is
supposed to work together. Each person has a special
task to accomplish and when these people all come
together, with their tasks finished, every aspect of the
community’s work is completely covered. Nothing is
left undone. In this case there are many different
specialists to meet the general goal of the committee.
When you take into account that a specialist
contributes only a small part of the generalist aspect, it
seems ridiculous to say that specialists are overrated.
The generalists looks to the specialists any time they
need help or clarification on their broad aspect.
Specialists and generalists are part of the same system,
so if a specialist is overrated, then so is a generalist.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 4
This is an adequate analysis of the issue. After a
somewhat confusing attempt to define “specialists” in
the introductory paragraph, the writer presents a
pertinent example (the special education teacher) to
illustrate the importance of specialists. The example
dominates the response and contributes positively to
the overall score of 4.
The second example, how a committee works, is
less persuasive. However, it does seem to help clarify
the writer’s definition of “general” as an umbrella
term meaning the total collection of what specialists
know about a topic.

Although the writer’s views about the relationship
between “generalist” and “specialist” are unusual,
they do become clear in the conclusion of the essay.
Yet, these ideas are not developed in sufficient depth
or with enough logical control to earn a score higher
than 4.
The writing is generally error free. There are few
problems in sentence structure, grammar, and usage,
although the phrasing is at times imprecise and
wordy. Overall, this response displays clearly adequate
control of the elements of written English.

To quote the saying, “Jack of all trades, master of none,”
would be my position on the statement. I feel specialists
in all areas of knowledge lead to a higher standard of
living for everyone. Specializing in different areas allows
us to use each others talents to the highest level and
maximize potential. As an example, if a person required
brain surgery, would they rather have a brain surgeon or
a general practitioner doing the work? Clearly a specialist would do the better job and give the patient a
chance at a better life.
A university education starts by laying the
groundwork for general knowledge but then narrows
down to a specific field. General knowledge and a
broad prospective are important, but if there was no
focus on specific areas, our overall knowledge as a
population would be seriously lessened.
Another example of specialists not being overated
would be international trade. Not every nation can
provide for themselves. They need to get products
and ideas from other parts of the world because they
are better at providing them. This allows for a
growing economy if two different nations can provide
each other with two different products. If one country
can produce oranges better than another, it should
trade the oranges for the fish that it can not produce.

Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 3
The writer’s position is clear: specialists are important
and necessary. However, the position is not adequately
supported with reasons or logical examples.
Paragraph 1 presents an appropriate example of
the brain surgeon versus the general practitioner.
However, the example of an increasingly narrow
university education in paragraph 2, contains only

two sentences and is seriously undeveloped. It does
little to advance the writer’s position.
Paragraph 3 offers yet another example, the most
developed of all. Unfortunately, this example is not
clearly logical. The writer tries to argue that the “specialist” country (one that is a better producer of oranges) is superior to the “generalist” country (presumably one that produces oranges as well as other products). This generalist country, the writer tells us, would
be inferior to the other. This conclusion does not
emerge logically from the writer’s argument, and it
seems to be at odds with everyday reality.
Although language is used with some imprecision
throughout the essay, the writer’s meaning is not
obscured. The main reasons for the score of 3 are the
lack of sufficient development and inappropriate use
of examples.

In the situation of health I feel that specialists are
very important. For example if a person has heart
problems, choose a heart specialist over a genral
medicine Dr. However if a person is having a wide
range of syptoms, perhaps choose a Dr. with a wide
range of experience might be more helpful.
It also depends on the type of problem you are
having. For example I would not suggest taking a
troubled child to a theorpist who specializes in
marriage problems. In some cases have a specialists
helps to insure that you are getting the best possibly
treatment. On the other hand dealing with a person
who has a wide range of experience may be able to
find different ways of dealing with a particular
problem.
Since the quotation did not state exactely what
type of specialist we are dealing with it is also hard to
determine the importance of having a specialist is. For
example the could be health or problems with a car, or
basically anything else. I feel that this information
should not have been left out. I guess the bottom line
is that I feel sometimes a specialist is very important.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 2
This is a seriously flawed analysis of the issue. The
response argues in favor of specialists, but neither the
reasons nor the examples are persuasive. The example
of not taking “a troubled child to see a therapist who
specializes in marriage problems” is both simplistic
and off the mark since it differentiates between two
specialists, not between a generalist and a specialist.

The sentences are so poorly formed and phrased
that the argument is at times hard to follow. Nevertheless, this is not a 1 essay: the writer presents a
position on the issue, develops that position with
some very weak analysis, and communicates some

I disagree with the statement about specialists, we
need specialists who take individual areas and
specialize. A generalists can pinpoint a problem. He
or she cannot determine the magnitude of the
problem. A specialist can find the root of the problem. When he or she has years working in that
specific field. For example, when i got sick i went to a
doctor. He did blood work, x-ray, talk to me, ect. He
prescribed me a medicine. I got worst. So i decided to
go another doctor. Now, i am doing great. A specialist
knows the facts right away. Otherwise, it will take
longer or not at all.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 1
This response presents a fundamentally deficient
discussion of the issue.
The first sentence states the writer’s position in
support of specialists, but that position is not followed
by a coherent argument. Some of the ideas seem
contradictory (e.g., “generalists can pinpoint a problem”) and the example is confusing. If the essay
explained that the first (unsuccessful) doctor was a
generalist and the second (successful) doctor was a
specialist, the example would be useful. However, as
written, the example is unclear and even misleading.
The concluding statement only adds to the confusion.
Since most of the sentences are short and choppy,
the ideas they try to communicate are also choppy.
The writer needs to provide transitional phrases and
ideas to bring logical cohesion to this response. Also,
basic errors in usage and grammar are pervasive, but it
is primarily the lack of a coherent argument that
makes this response a 1.

Analyze an Argument Task
The “Analyze an Argument” task assesses your ability
to understand, analyze, and evaluate arguments and
to clearly convey your analysis in writing. The task
consists of a brief passage in which the author makes
a case for some course of action or interpretation of
events by presenting claims backed by reasons and
evidence. Your task is to discuss the logical soundness

20

of the author’s case by critically examining the line of
reasoning and the use of evidence. This task requires
you to read the argument very carefully. You might
want to read it more than once and possibly make
brief notes about points you want to develop more
fully in your response. In reading the argument, you
should pay special attention to
• what is offered as evidence, support, or proof
• what is explicitly stated, claimed, or concluded
• what is assumed or supposed, perhaps without
justification or proof
• what is not stated, but necessarily follows from
what is stated
In addition, you should consider the structure of the
argument—the way in which these elements are
linked together to form a line of reasoning; that is, you
should recognize the separate, sometimes implicit
steps in the thinking process and consider whether
the movement from each one to the next is logically
sound. In tracing this line, look for transition words
and phrases that suggest that the author is attempting
to make a logical connection (e.g., however, thus,
therefore, evidently, hence, in conclusion).
An important part of performing well on the
Argument task is remembering what you are not
being asked to do. You are not being asked to discuss
whether the statements in the argument are true or
accurate; instead, you are being asked whether
conclusions and inferences are validly drawn from the
statements. You are not being asked to agree or
disagree with the position stated; instead, you are
being asked to comment on the thinking that underlies the position stated. You are not being asked to
express your own views on the subject being discussed
(as you were in the Issue task); instead, you are being
asked to evaluate the logical soundness of an argument of another writer and, in doing so, to demonstrate the critical thinking, perceptive reading, and
analytical writing skills that university faculty consider important for success in graduate school.
“Analyze an Argument” is primarily a critical
thinking task requiring a written response. Consequently, the analytical skills displayed in your critique
carry great weight in determining your score.
Understanding the Context for Writing: Purpose
and Audience
The purpose of the task is to see how well equipped
you are to insightfully analyze an argument written by
someone else and to effectively communicate your

critique in writing to an academic audience. Your
audience consists of college and university faculty
who are trained as GRE readers to apply the scoring
criteria identified in the scoring guide for the “Analyze an Argument” task (see page 52).
To get a clearer idea of how GRE readers apply the
Argument scoring criteria to actual essays, you should
review scored sample Argument essay responses and
readers’ commentaries. The sample responses, particularly at the 5 and 6 score levels, will show you a
variety of successful strategies for organizing and
developing an insightful critique. You will also see
many examples of particularly effective uses of
language. The readers’ commentaries discuss specific
aspects of analytical writing, such as cogency of ideas,
development and support, organization, syntactic
variety, and facility with language. These commentaries will point out aspects that are particularly effective and insightful as well as any that detract from
the overall effectiveness of the responses.
Preparing for the Argument Task
Because the Argument task is meant to assess analytical writing and informal reasoning skills that you
have developed throughout your education, it has
been designed so as not to require any specific course
of study or to advantage students with a particular
type of training. Many college textbooks on rhetoric
and composition have sections on informal logic and
critical thinking that might prove helpful, but even
these might be more detailed and technical than the
task requires. You will not be expected to know
methods of analysis or technical terms. For instance,
in one topic an elementary school principal might
conclude that the new playground equipment has
improved student attendance because absentee rates
have declined since it was installed. You will not
need to see that the principal has committed the post
hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy; you will simply need to
see that there are other possible explanations for the
improved attendance, to offer some common-sense
examples, and perhaps to suggest what would be
necessary to verify the conclusion. For instance,
absentee rates might have decreased because the
climate was mild. This would have to be ruled out in
order for the principal’s conclusion to be valid.
Although you do not need to know special
analytical techniques and terminology, you should be
familiar with the directions for the Argument task in

the Practice Tests and with certain key concepts,
including the following:
• alternative explanation—a possible competing
version of what might have caused the events in
question; an alternative explanation undercuts
or qualifies the original explanation because it
too can account for the observed facts
• analysis—the process of breaking something (e.g.,
an argument) down into its component parts in
order to understand how they work together to
make up the whole; also a presentation, usually in
writing, of the results of this process
• argument—a claim or a set of claims with
reasons and evidence offered as support; a line of
reasoning meant to demonstrate the truth or
falsehood of something
• assumption—a belief, often unstated or
unexamined, that someone must hold in order
to maintain a particular position; something
that is taken for granted but that must be true in
order for the conclusion to be true
• conclusion—the end point reached by a line of
reasoning, valid if the reasoning is sound; the
resulting assertion
• counterexample—an example, real or hypothetical, that refutes or disproves a statement in
the argument
An excellent way to prepare for the “Analyze an
Argument” topic is to practice writing on some of
the published Argument topics. There is no one way
to practice that is best for everyone. Some prefer to
start practicing without adhering to the 30-minute
time limit.
If you follow this approach, take all the time you
need to analyze the argument. No matter which
approach you take, you should
• carefully read the argument—you might want to
read it over more than once
• identify as many of its claims, conclusions, and
underlying assumptions as possible
• think of as many alternative explanations and
counterexamples as you can
• think of what additional evidence might weaken
or lend support to the claims
• ask yourself what changes in the argument
would make the reasoning more sound
Jot down each of these thoughts as a brief note.
When you’ve gone as far as you can with your analysis, look over the notes and put them in a good order

21

for discussion (perhaps by numbering them). Then
write a critique by fully developing each of your
points in turn. Even if you choose not to write a full
essay response, you should find it very helpful to
practice analyzing a few of the arguments and sketching out your responses. When you become quicker
and more confident, you should practice writing some
Argument responses within the 30-minute time limit
so that you will have a good sense of how to pace
yourself in the actual test. For example, you will not
want to discuss one point so exhaustively or to
provide so many equivalent examples that you run
out of time to make your other main points.
Next, compare your response(s) to the scoring
guide. Focus on seeing how your paper meets or
misses the performance standards and what you
therefore need to do in order to improve.
How to Interpret Numbers, Percentages, and
Statistics in Argument Topics
Some arguments contain numbers, percentages, or
statistics that are offered as evidence in support of the
argument’s conclusion. For example, an argument
might claim that a certain community event is less
popular this year than it was last year because only
100 people attended this year in comparison with 150
last year, a 33 percent decline in attendance. It is
important to remember that you are not being asked
to do a mathematical task with the numbers, percentages, or statistics. Instead you should evaluate these as
evidence that is intended to support the conclusion.
In the example above, the conclusion is that a
community event has become less popular. You
should ask yourself: does the difference between 100
people and 150 people support that conclusion? Note
that, in this case, there are other possible explanations; for example, the weather might have been
much worse this year, this year’s event might have
been held at an inconvenient time, the cost of the
event might have gone up this year, or there might
have been another popular event this year at the
same time. Each of these could explain the difference
in attendance, and thus would weaken the conclusion that the event was “less popular.” Similarly,
percentages might support or weaken a conclusion
depending on what actual numbers the percentages
represent. Consider the claim that the drama club at
a school deserves more funding because its membership has increased by 100 percent. This 100 percent

22

increase could be significant if there had been 100
members and now there are 200 members, whereas
the increase would be much less significant if there
had been 5 members and now there are 10. Remember that any numbers, percentages, or statistics in
Argument topics are used only as evidence in support
of a conclusion, and you should always consider
whether they actually support the conclusion.
The Form of Your Response
You are free to organize and develop your critique in
any way that you think will effectively communicate
your analysis of the argument. Your response may, but
need not, incorporate particular writing strategies
learned in English composition or writing-intensive
college courses. GRE readers will not be looking for a
particular developmental strategy or mode of writing.
In fact, when faculty are trained to be GRE readers,
they review hundreds of Argument responses that,
although highly diverse in content and form, display
similar levels of critical thinking and analytical
writing. Readers will see, for example, some essays at
the 6 score level that begin by briefly summarizing
the argument and then explicitly stating and developing the main points of the critique. The readers
know that a writer can earn a high score by analyzing
and developing several points in a critique or by
identifying a central flaw in the argument and
developing that critique extensively. You might want
to look at the sample Argument responses, particularly at the 5 and 6 score levels, to see how other
writers have successfully developed and organized
their critiques.
You should make choices about format and
organization that you think support and enhance the
overall effectiveness of your critique. This means
using as many or as few paragraphs as you consider
appropriate for your critique—for example, creating a
new paragraph when your discussion shifts to a new
point of analysis. You might want to organize your
critique around the organization of the argument
itself, discussing the argument line by line. Or you
might want to first point out a central questionable
assumption and then move on to discuss related flaws
in the argument’s line of reasoning. Similarly, you
might want to use examples if they help illustrate
an important point in your critique or move your
discussion forward (remember, however, that in
terms of your ability to perform the Argument task
effectively, it is your critical thinking and analytical

writing, not your ability to come up with examples,
that is being assessed). What matters is not the form
the response takes, but how insightfully you analyze
the argument and how articulately you communicate
your analysis to academic readers within the context
of the task.
Directions*
Discuss how well reasoned you find this argument.
Sample Topic
“Hospital statistics regarding people who go to the
emergency room after roller skating accidents indicate the need for more protective equipment. Within
this group of people, 75 percent of those who had
accidents in streets or parking lots were not wearing
any protective clothing (helmets, knee pads, etc.) or
any light-reflecting material (clip-on lights, glow-inthe-dark wrist pads, etc.). Clearly, these statistics
indicate that by investing in high-quality protective
gear and reflective equipment, roller skaters will
greatly reduce their risk of being severely injured in
an accident.”
Strategies for this Topic
This argument cites a particular hospital statistic to
support the general conclusion that “investing in
high-quality protective gear and reflective equipment” will reduce the risk of being severely injured in
a roller skating accident.
In developing your analysis, you should ask
yourself whether the hospital statistic actually
supports the conclusion. You might want to ask
yourself such questions as:
• What percentage of all roller skaters goes to the
emergency room after roller skating accidents?
• Are the people who go to the emergency room
after roller skating accidents representative of
roller skaters in general?
• Are there people who are injured in roller
skating accidents who do not go to the emergency room?
• Were the roller skaters who went to the emergency room severely injured?
• Were the 25 percent of roller skaters who were
wearing protective gear injured just as severely
as the 75 percent who were not wearing the
gear?
• Are streets and parking lots inherently more
dangerous for roller skating than other places?
*
**

• Would mid-quality gear and equipment be just
as effective as high-quality gear and equipment
in reducing the risk of severe injury while roller
skating?
• Are there factors other than gear and equipment—e.g., weather conditions, visibility, skill
of the skaters—that might be more closely
correlated with the risk of roller skating injuries?
Considering possible answers to questions such as
these will help you identify assumptions, alternative
explanations, and weaknesses that you can develop in
your critique of the argument.
Essay Response** – Score 6
The notion that protective gear reduces the injuries
suffered in accidents seems at first glance to be an
obvious conclusion. After all, it is the intent of these
products to either provent accidents from occuring in
the first place or to reduce the injuries suffered by the
wearer should an accident occur. However, the conclusion that investing in high quality protective gear
greatly reduces the risk of being severely injured in an
accident may mask other (and potentially more significant) causes of injuries and may inspire people to over
invest financially and psychologically in protective gear.
First of all, as mentioned in the argument, there
are two distinct kinds of gear—preventative gear
(such as light reflecting material) and protective gear
(such as helmets). Preventative gear is intended to
warn others, presumably for the most part motorists,
of the presence of the roller skater. It works only if
the “other” is a responsible and caring individual who
will afford the skater the necessary space and attention. Protective gear is intended to reduce the effect
of any accident, whether it is caused by an other, the
skater or some force of nature. Protective gear does
little, if anything, to prevent accidents but is presumed to reduce the injuries that occur in an accident. The statistics on injuries suffered by skaters
would be more interesting if the skaters were grouped
into those wearing no gear at all, those wearing
protective gear only, those wearing preventative gear
only and those wearing both. These statistics could
provide skaters with a clearer understanding of which
kinds of gear are more beneficial.
The argument above is weakened by the fact that
it does not take into account the inherent differences
between skaters who wear gear and those who do not.

The directions are presented as they appear on the actual test.
All responses in this publication are reproduced exactly as written, including errors, misspellings, etc., if any.

23

If is at least likely that those who wear gear may be
generally more responsible and/or safety conscious
individuals. The skaters who wear gear may be less
likely to cause accidents through careless or dangerous behavior. It may, in fact, be their natural caution
and repsonsibility that keeps them out of the emergency room rather than the gear itself. Also, the
statistic above is based entirely on those who are
skating in streets and parking lots which are relatively
dangerous places to skate in the first place. People
who are generally more safety conscious (and therefore more likely to wear gear) may choose to skate in
safer areas such as parks or back yards.
The statistic also goes not differentiate between
severity of injuries. The conclusion that safety gear
prevents severe injuries suggests that it is presumed
that people come to the emergency room only with
severe injuries. This is certainly not the case. Also,
given that skating is a recreational activity that may
be primarily engaged in during evenings and weekends (when doctors’ offices are closed), skater with
less severe injuries may be especially likely to come to
the emergency room for treatment.
Finally, there is absolutely no evidence provided
that high quality (and presumably more expensive)
gear is any more beneficial than other kinds of gear.
For example, a simple white t-shirt may provide the
same preventative benefit as a higher quality, more
expensive, shirt designed only for skating. Before
skaters are encouraged to invest heavily in gear, a
more complete understanding of the benefit provided
by individual pieces of gear would be helpful.
The argument for safety gear based on emergency
room statistics could provide important information
and potentially saves lives. Before conclusions about
the amount and kinds of investments that should be
made in gear are reached, however, a more complete
understanding of the benefits are needed. After all, a
false confidence in ineffective gear could be just as
dangerous as no gear at all.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 6
This outstanding response demonstrates the writer’s
insightful analytical skills. The introduction, which
notes that adopting the topic’s fallacious reasoning
could “. . . inspire people to over invest financially
and psychologically in protective gear,” is followed by
a comprehensive examination of each of the

24

argument’s root flaws. Specifically, the writer exposes
several points that undermine the argument:
• that preventive and protective gear are not the
same
• that skaters who wear gear may be less prone to
accidents because they are, by nature, more
responsible and cautious
• that the statistics do not differentiate by the
severity of the injuries
• that gear may not need to be high-quality to be
beneficial
The discussion is smoothly and logically organized,
and each point is thoroughly and cogently developed.
In addition, the writing is succinct, economical, and
generally error-free. Sentences are varied and complex, and diction is expressive and precise.
In sum, this response exemplifies the very top of
the 6 range described in the scoring guide. If the
writer had been less eloquent or provided fewer
reasons to refute the argument, the paper could still
have received a 6.
Essay Response – Score 5
The argument presented is limited but useful. It
indicates a possible relationship between a high
percentage of accidents and a lack of protective
equipment. The statistics cited compel a further
investigation of the usefulness of protective gear in
preventing or mitigating roller-skating related
injuries. However, the conclusion that protective gear
and reflective equipment would “greatly reduce.risk of
being severely injured” is premature. Data is lacking
with reference to the total population of skaters and
the relative levels of experience, skill and physical
coordination of that population. It is entirely possible
that further research would indicate that most serious
injury is averted by the skater’s ability to react quickly
and skillfully in emergency situations.
Another area of investigation necessary before
conclusions can be reached is identification of the
types of injuries that occur and the various causes of
those injuries. The article fails to identify the most
prevalent types of roller-skating related injuries. It
also fails to correlate the absence of protective gear
and reflective equipment to those injuries. For
example, if the majority of injuries are skin abrasions
and closed-head injuries, then a case can be made for
the usefulness of protective clothing mentioned.

Likewise, if injuries are caused by collision with
vehicles (e.g. bicycles, cars) or pedestrians, then
light-reflective equipment might mitigate the
occurences. However, if the primary types of injuries
are soft-tissue injuries such as torn ligaments and
muscles, back injuries and the like, then a greater
case could be made for training and experience as
preventative measures.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 5
This strong response gets right to the work of critiquing the argument, observing that it “indicates a
possible relationship” but that its conclusion “is
premature.” It raises three central questions that, if
answered, might undermine the soundness of the
argument:
• What are the characteristics of the total population of skaters?
• What is the usefulness of protective or reflective
gear in preventing or mitigating roller skatingrelated injuries?
• What are the types of injuries sustained and
their causes?
The writer develops each of these questions by
considering possible answers that would either
strengthen or weaken the argument. The paper does
not analyze the argument as insightfully or develop
the critique as fully as required for a 6 paper, but the
clear organization, strong control of language, and
substantial degree of development warrant more than
a score of 4.
Essay Response – Score 4
Although the argument stated above discusses the
importance of safety equipment as significant part of
avoiding injury, the statistics quoted are vague and
inconclusive. Simply because 75 percent of the people
involved in roller-skating accidents are not wearing the
stated equipment does not automatically implicate the
lack of equipment as the cause of injury. The term
“accidents” may imply a great variety of injuries. The
types of injuries one could incur by not wearing the
types of equipment stated above are minor head injuries; skin abrasions or possibly bone fracture of a select
few areas such as knees, elbows, hands, etc. (which are
in fact most vulnerable to this sport); and/or injuries
due to practising the sport during low light times of the
day. During any physically demanding activity or sport
people are subjected to a wide variety of injuries which
cannot be avoided with protective clothing or light-

reflective materials. These injuries include inner trauma
(e.g., heart-attack); exhaustion; strained muscles,
ligaments, or tendons; etc. Perhaps the numbers and
percentages of people injured during roller-skating, even
without protective equipment, would decrease greatly if
people participating in the sport had proper training,
good physical health, warm-up properly before beginning (stretching), as well as take other measures to
prevent possible injury, such as common-sense, by
refraining from performing the activity after proper
lighting has ceased and knowing your personal limitations as an individual and athlete. The statistics used in
the above reasoning are lacking in proper direction
considering their assertions and therefore must be
further examined and modified so that proper conclusions can be reached.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 4
This adequate response targets the argument’s vague
and inconclusive “statistics.” The essay identifies and
critiques the illogical reasoning that results from the
misguided use of the argument’s statistics:
• that non-use of equipment may be “automatically” assumed to be the cause of injury
• that “accidents” may refer to minor injuries
• that injuries may result from other causes —
skating in the dark, failure to train or warm-up
properly, failure to recognize one’s physical
limitations
The writer competently grasps the weaknesses of the
argument. The ideas are clear and connected, but the
response lacks transitional phrases. Development,
too, is only adequate.
Control of language is better than adequate. The
writer achieves both control and clarity and ably
conforms to the conventions of written English.
Overall, though, this 4 response lacks the more
thorough development that would warrant a score of 5.

The arguement is well presented and supported, but
not completely well reasoned. It is clear and concisely
written. The content is logically and smoothly
presented. Statistics cited are used to develop support
for the recommendation, that roller skaters who
invest in protective gear and reflective equipment
can reduce their risk of severe, accidental injuries.
Examples of the types of protective equipment are
described for the reader. Unfortunately, the author of
the argement fails to note that merely by purchasing

25

gear and reflective equipment that the skater will be
protected. This is, of course, falacious if the skater
fails to use the equipment, or uses it incorrectly or
inappropriately. It is also an unnecessary assumption
that a skater need purchase high-quality gear for the
same degree of effectiveness to be achieved. The
argument could be improved by taking these issues
into consideration, and making recommendations for
education and safety awareness to skaters.

The first half of this generally well-written but
limited response merely describes the argument. The
second half of the paper identifies two assumptions of

• that people who purchase protective gear will
use the gear
• that high-quality gear is more effective than
other gear
These points are sufficient to constitute some analysis
and thus warrant a score of 3. However, neither of
these analytic points is developed sufficiently to merit
a score of 4.

To reduce the accidents from roller skating we should
consider about it causes and effects concurrently to
find the best solution. Basically the roller-skating
players are children, they had less experiences to
protect themselves from any kind of dangerous.
Therefore, it should be a responsible of adult to take
care them. Adult should recommend their child to
wear any protective clothing, set the rules and look
after them while they are playing.
In the past roller-skating is limited in the skate
yard but when it became popular people normally
play it on the street way) Therefore the number of
accidents from roller-skating is increased. The skate
manufacturer should have a responsibility in producing a protective clothing. They should promote and
sell them together with skates. The government or
state should set the regulation of playing skate on the
street way like they did with the bicycle.
To prevent this kind of accident is the best
solution but it needs a coorperation among us to have
a concious mind to beware and realize its dangerous.

more times.
Language and usage are equally problematic. The
few words that have been added, in combination with
the words of the topic, result in incoherence. In sum,
this essay fits all of the scoring guide descriptors for a 1.

Taking the Practice GRE
General Test
After you have become familiar with the three
sections of the General Test, it is time to take the
practice test in this book to see how well you do. Not
only will this help you become familiar with the
directions and types of questions, it will help you
determine how to pace yourself during an actual test.
The practice General Test begins on page 29. The
total time that should be allotted for this practice test
is 31/4 hours. The time that should be allotted for each
section appears at the beginning of the section. The
answer sheets are provided on pages 63–72.

Evaluating Your
Performance
After you have taken the practice General Test in
this book, it is time to evaluate your performance.

Verbal and Quantitative Sections
Appendix B on pages 54-55 contains information to
help you evaluate your performance on the verbal
and quantitative sections. A table of the correct
answers to the questions in the verbal and quantitative sections is provided on page 54. Compare your
answer to each question to the correct answer given
in the list, crossing out questions you answered
incorrectly or omitted. You can also evaluate your
performance by looking at how you performed on
each test question compared to others who answered
the questions at an actual administration. In the table

on page 54, there is a number to the right of each
correct answer, P‫ .ם‬The P‫ ם‬is the percent of
examinees who answered the question correctly and
is based on the examinees who took that edition of
the test. This information enables you to see how
other examinees performed on each question. It can
also help identify content areas in which you need
more practice and review.
Next, add the number of correct answers in
Sections II and IV to obtain your raw verbal score.
Add the number of correct answers in Sections III
and V to obtain your raw quantitative score. Once
you have obtained your raw scores, you can look up
your scaled scores on both sections. The score
conversion table on page 55 provides the scaled
scores that correspond to the raw scores on each
section.
The score conversion table also allows you to
compare your scaled scores with those of others who
have taken the General Test. The table provides for
each scaled score, the percent of examinees who
earned lower scores, and is based on those examinees
who took the verbal and quantitative sections on
the General Test between October 1, 1998 and
September 30, 2001. For example, the column next
to the verbal scaled score 460 indicates 48 percent.
This means that 48 percent of the examinees tested
between October 1998 and September 2001 earned
verbal scores below 460. For each score you earned
on this practice test, note the percent of GRE examinees who earned lower scores. This is a reasonable
indication of your rank among GRE General Test
examinees if you have taken the practice test under
standard timing conditions.
It may be helpful to compare your score to scores
of examinees whose intended graduate school major
field is similar to your own. The mean scores table on
page 55 shows you the average scores of people in
various categories of intended graduate major fields
who took the General Test between October 1998
and September 2001. You can evaluate your scores by
finding the major field category most closely related
to your career goals and see how your performance
compares with others who are striving for similar
goals.

Analytical Writing Section
One way to evaluate your performance on the Issue
and Argument topics you answered on the practice
test is to compare your essay responses to the scored

27

sample essay responses for these topics and review the
reader commentary for these sample essay responses.
Scored sample essay responses at selected score levels
and reader commentary are presented in Appendix C
on pages 56-62 for the two Issue topics and one
Argument topic presented in the analytical writing
section of the test.
The final scores on each of the two essays (Issue
and Argument) are averaged and rounded up to the
nearest half-point interval. A single score is reported
for the analytical writing section. You should review
the score level descriptions on page 53 to better
understand the analytical writing abilities characteristic of particular score levels.

Additional Preparation
Once you have evaluated your performance on the
practice General Test in this book, you can determine
what type of additional preparation you might want
to do for the test.

Analytical Writing 1
PRESENT YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON AN ISSUE
45 minutes
You will have a choice between two Issue topics. Each topic will appear as a brief quotation that
states or implies an issue of general interest. Read each topic carefully; then decide on which
topic you could write a more effective and well-reasoned response.
You will have 45 minutes to plan and compose a response that presents your perspective
on the topic you select. A response on any other topic will receive a zero. You are free to
accept, reject, or qualify the claim made in the topic you selected, as long as the ideas you
present are clearly relevant to the topic. Support your views with reasons and examples
drawn from such areas as your reading, experience, observations, or academic studies.
GRE readers, who are college and university faculty, will read your response and evaluate
its overall quality, based on how well you do the following:
• consider the complexities and implications of the issue
• organize, develop, and express your ideas on the issue
• support your ideas with relevant reasons and examples
• control the elements of standard written English
You may want to take a few minutes to think about the issue and to plan a response before
you begin writing. Because the space for writing your response is limited, use the next
page to plan your response. Be sure to develop your ideas fully and organize them coherently, but leave time to reread what you have written and make any revisions that you think
are necessary.

Present your perspective on one of the issues below, using relevant reasons and/or examples to support your views.
Topic
No:
C100. “Both the development of technological tools and the uses to which humanity has put them have
created modern civilizations in which loneliness is ever increasing.”
C101. “Our declining environment may bring the people of the world together as no politician, philosopher,
or war ever could. Environmental problems are global in scope and respect no nation’s boundaries.
Therefore, people are faced with the choice of unity and cooperation on the one hand or disunity and
a common tragedy on the other.”
Write the topic number of the issue you choose on the line at the top right corner of the answer booklet
labeled “Analytical Writing 1: Issue.”

Analytical Writing 2
ANALYZE AN ARGUMENT
30 minutes
You will have 30 minutes to plan and write a critique of an argument presented in the form of
a short passage. A critique of any other argument will receive a score of zero.
Analyze the line of reasoning in the argument. Be sure to consider what, if any, questionable
assumptions underlie the thinking and, if evidence is cited, how well it supports the conclusion.
You can also discuss what sort of evidence would strengthen or refute the argument, what
changes in the argument would make it more logically sound, and what additional information
might help you better evaluate its conclusion. Note that you are NOT being asked to present
your views on the subject.
GRE readers, who are college and university faculty, will read your critique and evaluate its
overall quality, based on how well you
• identify and analyze important features of the argument
• organize, develop, and express your critique of the argument
• support your critique with relevant reasons and examples
• control the elements of standard written English
Before you begin writing, you may want to take a few minutes to evaluate the argument
and plan a response. Because the space for writing your response is limited, use the next
page to plan your response. Be sure to develop your ideas fully and organize them
coherently, but leave time to reread what you have written and make any revisions that you
think are necessary.

32

Discuss how well reasoned you find this argument.
Topic
No:
C103. Six months ago the region of Forestville increased the speed limit for vehicles traveling on the
region’s highways by ten miles per hour. Since that change took effect, the number of automobile
accidents in that region has increased by 15 percent. But the speed limit in Elmsford, a region
neighboring Forestville, remained unchanged, and automobile accidents declined slightly during
the same six-month period. Therefore, if the citizens of Forestville want to reduce the number of
automobile accidents on the region’s highways, they should campaign to reduce Forestville’s speed
limit to what it was before the increase.
Write the topic number of the argument on the line at the top right corner of the answer booklet labeled
“Analytical Writing 2: Argument.”

Analytical Writing Section Score
Level Descriptions
Although the GRE Analytical Writing measure
contains two discrete analytical writing tasks, a single
combined score is reported because it is more reliable
than is a score for either task alone. The reported
score, the average of the scores for the two tasks,
ranges from 0 to 6, in half-point increments.
The statements below describe, for each score
level, the overall quality of analytical writing demonstrated across both the Issue and Argument tasks.
Because the test assesses “analytical writing,” critical
thinking skills (the ability to reason, assemble
evidence to develop a position, and communicate
complex ideas) weigh more heavily than the writer’s
control of fine points of grammar or the mechanics of
writing (e.g., spelling).
SCORES 6 and 5.5 – Sustains insightful, in-depth
analysis of complex ideas; develops and supports main
points with logically compelling reasons and/or
highly persuasive examples; is well focused and well
organized; skillfully uses sentence variety and precise
vocabulary to convey meaning effectively; demonstrates superior facility with sentence structure and
language usage but may have minor errors that do not
interfere with meaning.
SCORES 5 and 4.5 – Provides generally thoughtful
analysis of complex ideas; develops and supports main
points with logically sound reasons and/or wellchosen examples; is generally focused and well
organized; uses sentence variety and vocabulary to
convey meaning clearly; demonstrates good control
of sentence structure and language usage but may
have minor errors that do not interfere with meaning.

SCORES 4 and 3.5 – Provides competent analysis of
complex ideas; develops and supports main points
with relevant reasons and/or examples; is adequately
organized; conveys meaning with reasonable clarity;
demonstrates satisfactory control of sentence structure and language usage but may have some errors
that affect clarity.
SCORES 3 and 2.5 – Displays some competence in
analytical writing, although the writing is flawed in at
least one of the following ways: limited analysis or
development; weak organization; weak control of
sentence structure or language usage, with errors that
often result in vagueness or lack of clarity.
SCORES 2 and 1.5 – Displays serious weaknesses in
analytical writing. The writing is seriously flawed in
at least one of the following ways: serious lack of
analysis or development; lack of organization; serious
and frequent problems in sentence structure or
language usage, with errors that obscure meaning.
SCORES 1 and .5 – Displays fundamental deficiencies in analytical writing. The writing is fundamentally flawed in at least one of the following ways:
content that is extremely confusing or mostly irrelevant to the assigned tasks; little or no development;
severe and pervasive errors that result in incoherence.
SCORE 0 – The examinee’s analytical writing skills
cannot be evaluated because the responses do not
address any part of the assigned tasks, are merely
attempts to copy the assignments, are in a foreign
language, or display only indecipherable text.
SCORE NS – The examinee produced no text
whatsoever.

Issue Topic 1
“Our declining environment may bring the people of
the world together as no politician, philosopher, or
war ever could. Environmental problems are global in
scope and respect no nation’s boundaries. Therefore,
people are faced with the choice of unity and cooperation on the one hand or disunity and a common
tragedy on the other.”
Essay Response – Score 6
Cooperation—or Tragedy?
The solution to the world’s growing environmental
problems may have to wait awhile. It has been said
that “environmental problems are global and respect
no nation’s boundaries.” Unfortunately, pollution and
its consequences still fall to large measure on those
least likely to do anything about it: poor countries
willing to sacrifice anything in order to sit at the
table with the world’s wealthy.
As far as the industrialized nations of the world
are concerned, the world is a big place. Environmental destruction taking place outside their borders may
sometimes be fodder for government pronouncements
of concern, but few concrete actions. Deforestation of
the Amazon, for instance, is of vital concern to all
those who wish to continue breathing. But the only
effective deterrent to this activity, the restriction of
international aid money to those countries showing
net deforestation, has been stalled in the United
Nations by those unwilling to “interfere” in the
internal politics of other nations.
Because of the differential impact of polluting
activities around the world, and even in different
regions of a single country, many governments will
undoubtedly continue to promulgate only modest
environmental regulations. Costs to polluting companies will continue to carry as much weight as the
benefit of a pollution-free environment. Particularly
in the current political climate of the United States,
*

56

the well-documented expense of today’s pollutioncontrol measures will be stacked against the unknown
long-term effects of polluting actitivities. “Why
should I spend millions of dollars a year, which causes
me to have to raise the cost of my goods or eliminate
jobs, if no one really knows if air pollution is all that
harmful? Show me the proof,” an air polluting
company may demand.
Realistically, it won’t be until critical mass is
achieved that the hoped for “choice of unity and
cooperation” will be a viable one. Only when the
earth as a whole is so polluted that life itself becomes
increasingly difficult for a majority of the world’s
people will there likely be the political will to force
global environmental laws on governments worldwide. But the optimists (read: environmental activists) among us continue to believe that the world can
be shown the error of its ways. They continue to
point out that the sky is probably falling—or at least
developing a big hole. The world, as a whole, ignores
them.
One would hope, however, that governments,
perhaps through a strengthened U.N., could somehow be forced to realize that when the Earth reaches
the critical mass of pollution, it may be too late to do
anything about it. That would be a “common tragedy” indeed.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 6
This excellent response displays an in-depth analysis
of the issue, conveyed through the skillful use of
language.
While acknowledging that environmental problems are serious and of global dimensions, the discussion explores the complexity of international cooperation. Such cooperation, the paper argues, runs into
a variety of problems, and the writer offers persuasive
examples to support that point:
• the unwillingness of nations to “interfere” with
other nations through political measures such as
restriction of foreign aid
• inadequate environmental regulations, which
are caused both by “the differential impact of
polluting activities” between countries and
regions and by the difficulty of comparing the
“long-term effects of polluting actitivities” with
the more easily documented, short-term costs of
reducing pollution.

Responses are reproduced exactly as written, including errors, misspellings, etc., if any.

The paper distinguishes itself in part by its excellent
organization. The first paragraph analyzes the claim
and announces the writer’s position; the second and
third paragraphs provide clear examples supporting
that position. The skillful use of a quotation from a
business person vividly illustrates the economic impact
of pollution controls. The last two paragraphs bring a
sense of closure to the essay by continuing the theme
announced in the first paragraph—that cooperation
must wait until more dire circumstances produce the
political will necessary to reduce pollution.
Transitional phrases—“because,” “however,” “for
instance”—help guide the reader through the argument. Also, effective sentence variety and the use of
precise vocabulary help clarify meaning and confirm
the score of 6.
Essay Response – Score 4
Our declining environment may bring the people of
the world together as no politician, philosopher, or
war ever could. Environmental issues are a growing
concern in our country today. It is an issue that
concerns every person, no one is excluded.
Facing and solving environmental issues calls for
unity and cooperation. Prejudices should be put aside
in this time of need. Without unity our world as we
know it will not exist in twenty-five years. People as a
whole need to take action. Without unity and
cooperation little will be accomplished.
There are many environmental issues we are
facing today. For example, recycling is a simple and
effective way to help the environment. If everyone
did a small part the results would be enormous.
Recycling is a good example because it is something
every single person is capable of doing.
There are many ways people of any age, race, or
sex can contribute to help the environment. Emissions testing for exhausts on automobiles is one way
to help keep unnecessary pollutants from contaminating the air. Very few cities require emissions
testing for automobiles. Columbus, for example, does
not require emissions testing. My small hometown of
Amherst, Ohio does require this test.
I believe the government needs to implement
stricter regulations regarding environmental issues
and also increase the funding that is allotted for it.
Mandatory recycling laws with a stiff penalty for
breaking the law is one solution. Funding for groups
to do research is imperative. Without research there

is very little we would know about anything including diseases and microorganisms.
People of the world need to understand the
situation our generation and generations to come are
faced with. This understanding needs to come from
education. The United States has always been a
forerunner in wars, peace talks, etc. It is now time for
the United States to be the leader in solutions to
environmental concerns. The greatest barrier in any
situation is communication. If we communicate with
each other and work together instead of apart results
would be seen. Education is another great concern,
especially in underdeveloped countries and third
world nations. There is a lack of education in many
of these countries. Education is the key to success.
In summary I would like to emphasize the importance in unity and cooperation on global concerns
such as the environment. Also education is very
important in making headway. I also believe the
government should get more involved in these issues.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 4
This paper presents and supports an adequate analysis
of the issue. After stating the need for cooperation on
the environment, the writer proposes several very
specific remedies for environmental problems:
recycling, emissions testing, research, education, and
communication. The detailed description of emissions testing is useful; however, the other remedies
(recycling, research, etc.) are not developed fully or
persuasively.
In some areas the response suffers from needless
repetition. Paragraph six, for example, moves from
education to communication and back to education.
The conclusion, moreover, adds little, merely repeating earlier statements.
The control of grammar and usage is generally
competent, but the sentences tend to be choppy.
Although most of the ideas are stated clearly, the
relationship between the ideas is not always made
clear: “Also education is very important in making
headway. I also believe the government should get
more involved in these issues.”
Essay Response – Score 2
Environmental problems will require a joint efferct
amoung people to solve, however, environmental
problems may not cause people to come together.
Should the problems continue for an extended period
of time before any effert is made to solve them, they

57

will reach a point of no return no matter how people
come together to work on it. When this happens
there will be increased shortage in our natural
resouses. As supply of our resouces goes down and
demand remains the same or goes up there will be
increased presure to claim what resouces remain. So
instead of people working together to solve the
problem, they will be fighting for what’s left by the
problem.
To solve this, people need to come together before
the problem reaches a state of no return. This may be
hard to do since the effects of environmental problems are not yet felt by a large degree (if felt at all) by
everyone. At this point in time many feel it is not
there problem to worry about since it does not
immediatly effect them. To remidy this people should
become more aware of their current environment.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 2
This response is seriously flawed. Its strongest feature
is a fairly clear position: it agrees with the claim that
environmental problems will require cooperation and
presents a scenario for what will happen if there is no
cooperation—conflict over diminishing resources.
However, the writer offers little support for that
position. Threatened “resources” and the “effects of
environmental problems” are mentioned but not
specified, and the paper provides no examples of how
people might “come together” to address the problem
or how they might “become more aware of their
current environment.”
Some of the sentences are worded clearly (“So
instead of people working together . . .”), but others
are so flawed by imprecise word choice that the
meaning is difficult to understand: “. . . not yet felt by
a large degree (if felt at all) by everyone.”
Also, run-on sentences (the first sentence, for
example) and unclear pronoun references add to the
confusion, reinforcing the score of 2.

Issue Topic 2
“Both the development of technological tools and
the uses to which humanity has put them have
created modern civilizations in which loneliness is
ever increasing.”
Essay Response – Score 6
Technology, broadly defined as the use of tools, has a
long history. Ever since Erg the caveman first conked
an animal with a rock, people have been using
technology. For thousands of years, the use of tools

58

allowed people to move ever closer together. Because
fields could be cultivated and the technology to store
food existed, people would live in cities rather than
in small nomadic tribes. Only very lately have Erg’s
descendants come to question the benefits of technology. The Industrial Revolution introduced and
spread technologies that mechanized many tasks. As
a result of the drive toward more efficient production
and distribution (so the ever larger cities would be
supported), people began to act as cogs in the technological machine. Clothing was no longer produced by
groups of women sewing and gossiping together, but
by down-trodden automation’s operating machinery
in grim factories.
The benefits of the new technology of today,
computers and the internet, are particularly ambiguous. They have made work ever more efficient and
knit the world together in a web of information and
phone lines. Some visionaries speak of a world in
which Erg need not check in to his office; he can just
dial in from home. He won’t need to go to a bar to
pick up women because there are all those chat
rooms. Hungry? Erg orders his groceries from an
online delivery service. Bored? Download a new
game. And yet...
Many people, myself included, are a little queasy
about that vision. Erg may be doing work, but is it
real work? Are his online friends real friends? Does
anything count in a spiritual way if it’s just digital?
Since the Industrial Revolution, we have been
haunted by the prospect that we are turning into our
machines: efficient, productive, souless. The newest
technologies, we fear, are making us flat as our
screens, turning us into streams of bits of
interchangable data. We may know a lot of people,
but we have few real friends. We have a lot of things
to do, but no reason to do them. In short, the new
technology emphasizes a spiritual crisis that has been
building for quite some time.
As I try to unravel which I believe about the
relative merits of technology, I think it is instructive
to remember technology’s original result. A better
plow meant easier farming, more food, longer lives,
and more free time to pursue other things such as art.
Our newest technology does not give us more free
time; it consumes our free time. We are terminally
distracted from confronting ourselves or each other.
We stay safe, and lonely, in our homes and offices
rather than taking the risk of meeting real people or
trying new things.

While I am certainly not a Luddite, I do believe
we need to look for a bit more balance between
technology and life. We have to tear ourselves away
from the fatal distractions and go out into the world.
Technology has given us long lives and endless
supplies of information. Now we need to apply that
information, use the time we’re not spending conking
our dinner with a club, and find our reasons for
living.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 6
This outstanding response displays cogent reasoning,
insightful, persuasive analysis, and superior control of
language. The response immediately identifies the
complexities of the issue and then playfully explores
both the benefits and the drawbacks of technological
developments over the course of human history. The
writer maintains that a “balance between technology
and life” is necessary if humans are going to abate the
loneliness that is part of modern existence.
In contrasting the intended purpose of technology
at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution with
the end result of the use of today’s technology, the
writer skillfully expands the initial position and
makes a sound point: While technological developments have helped society in a practical way, they
have contributed to a spiritual crisis that has been
building for quite some time.
The analysis is tightly organized. With wellchosen examples and a character called Erg, the
response moves well beyond a listing of examples,
developing the analysis over five focused paragraphs,
each building on the previous one. The conclusion—
that as a result of technology the individual begins to
lose sight of the need to connect with fellow citizens
in a meaningful way—follows directly from the
preceding paragraphs, while adding substantive
analysis.
This writer is clearly in command of language and
syntax, varying the sentence structure to express
concepts succinctly. Word choice is generally precise
and often highly effective, as in the following examples: “down-trodden automation,” and “haunted
by the prospect that we are turning into our machines: efficient, productive, soulless.”
Essay Response – Score 4
Looking at the above statement, I see a lot of truth to
the statement. There are many ways that society has
used the advanced technology in order to isolate

themselves. It may or may not be a consious move,
but the results are all the same. The isolation occurs
in a variety of ways and in all different areas. By
computerizing factories, there are more and more
people working long hours by themselves, with there
only companion as a computer monitor. Although
the company may be getting better production, the
question that needs to be ask is at what cost to their
employees.
It is not only the management of big factories that
are responsible for this isolation. This lonliness can
be seen in many other settings. With the growing
popularity of the television, the nation is seeing a
decline in families talking and an increase in watching the television. Not only can this result in a
generation of “coach potatoes”, it is also causes less
communication and a feeling of isolation from
everyone that a person cares about.
So far technology has entered the work place and
the home, it has also entered the social relm. When
you go to order food in the drive-thru, who is or
better yet what is it that you talk to? It is a machine,
although there is a person on the other end, you are
still reciting your order to a machine. If it is ten
o’clock at night and you need money, there are
ATM’s. All of these gadgets may be very nice and
convient, but they result in lack of human contact.
Although it might be easy to blame technolgy for
our feelings of loneliness, it is just a cop out. By
looking at all the ways technology causes isolation, it
is still people who choose to use these convenient
methods. If a person wants to have human contact,
all they have to do is go inside to the bank or go
inside the resturaunt to order. What it basically boils
down to, is that it is our choice whether or not we use
technology. It is a scary thought to think maybe one
day we might live in a society where you will never
have to leave your house. That by using FAX machines, computers, modems, and the telephone a
person would never have to have human contact to
get their job done. The thing is that if that is not
what we as a society wants, we are the ones to speak
out and change the outcome.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 4
This is a competent discussion of the issue. The
position presented in the first paragraph—that “there
are many ways that society has used the advanced
technology in order to isolate themselves”—is
adequately sustained, but the examples are not always

59

clearly relevant (e.g., in the case of paragraph one’s
“computerizing” of factories, the decision to use the
technology is not made by the individual worker.)
Also, the reasoning is not developed as fully as it
would be in a response at the score level of 6 or 5.
While organization is adequate, the response lacks
the organized coherence of ideas that exemplify a 5
essay. Transitions, within and between paragraphs,
are not always logical. The last paragraph could be
much more clearly focused: since several sentences
repeat the same idea—that “it is our choice
whether or not we use technology”—and the
purpose or meaning of others (e.g., the last) is not
immediately clear.
In general, ideas are presented clearly, although
awkward phrasing sometimes contributes to vagueness (e.g., “By looking at all the ways technology
causes isolation, it is still people who choose to use
these convenient methods”). Lack of sentence variety
seems to inhibit the communication of ideas (e.g.,
many short sentences are often used where one or
two compound ones could make the points more
effectively). Overall, however, this is an adequate
response to the topic.
Essay Response – Score 2
Computers of all shapes and sizes, p.c.’s, laptops,

our society as great technological advances. Not
many would argue that the development of these

However they certainly seem to be making our world
one in which contact with our fellow man is less and
less necessary. Though some may be more comfortable not having to engage in direct contact, it is
questionable whether this is beneficial to society as a
whole. The very least result could in fact be a very
lonely world, but it may result in more significant
problems.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 2
This response is seriously flawed. The analysis of the
issue is extremely limited, and there are serious
problems in sentence structure. The writer’s position,
never clearly stated, seems to be that as a result of
technological developments, “contact with our fellow
man is less and less necessary.” However, the implications of this statement (and others) are never
explored or developed. Furthermore, the list of
technological advancements does not support or
clarify the writer’s already tenuously held position.

60

Each new sentence could serve as a springboard to a
thoughtful analysis but instead takes the response
further from the apparent premise.
This response received a score of 2, not because of
language problems, but because reasoning, analysis,
and development are extremely thin and insubstantial.

Argument Topic
“Six months ago the region of Forestville increased
the speed limit for vehicles traveling on the region’s
highways by ten miles per hour. Since that change
took effect, the number of automobile accidents in
that region has increased by 15 percent. But the
speed limit in Elmsford, a region neighboring
Forestville, remained unchanged, and automobile
accidents declined slightly during the same sixmonth period. Therefore, if the citizens of Forestville
want to reduce the number of automobile accidents
on the region’s highways, they should campaign to
reduce Forestville’s speed limit to what it was before
the increase.”
Essay Response – Score 6
The agrument is well-presented, but not thoroughly
well-reasoned. By making a comparison of the region
of Forestville, the town with the higher speed limit
and therefore automobile accidents, with the region
of Elmsford, an area of a lower speed limit and
subsequently fewer accidents, the argument for
reducing Forestville’s speed limits in order to decrease
accidents seems logical.
However, the citizens of Forestville are failing to
consider other possible alternatives to the increasing
car accidents after the raise in speed limit. Such
alternatives may include the fact that there are less
reliable cars traveling the roads in Forestville, or that
the age bracket of those in Elmsford may be more
conducive to driving safely. It is possible that there
are more younger, inexperienced, or more elderly,
unsafe drivers in Forestville than there are in
Elmsford. In addition, the citizens have failed to
consider the geographical and physical terrain of the
two different areas. Perhaps Forestville’s highway is in
an area of more dangerous curves, sharp turns, or has
many intersections or merging points where accidents
are more likely to occur. It appears reasonable,
therefore, for the citizens to focus on these trouble
spots than to reduce the speed in the entire area.
Elmsford may be an area of easier driving conditions
where accidents are less likely to occur regardless of
the speed limit.

A six-month period is not a particularly long time
frame for the citizens to determine that speed limit
has influenced the number of automobile accidents in
the area. It is mentioned in the argument that
Elmsford accidents decreased during the time period.
This may have been a time, such as during harsh
weather conditions, when less people were driving on
the road and therefore the number of accidents
decreased. However, Forestville citizens, perhaps
coerced by employment or other requirements, were
unable to avoid driving on the roads. Again, the
demographics of the population are important. It is
possible that Elmsford citizens do not have to travel
far from work or work from their home, or do not
work at all. Are there more people in Forestville than
there were sic months ago? If so, there may be an
increased number of accidents due to more automobiles on the road, and not due to the increased speed
limits. Also in reference to the activities of the
population, it is possible that Forestville inhabitants
were traveling during less safe times of the day, such
as early in the morning, or during twilight. Work or
family habits may have encouraged citizens to drive
during this time when Elmsford residents may not
have been forced to do so.
Overall, the reasoning behind decreasing
Forestville’s speed limit back to its original seems
logical as presented above since the citizens are
acting in their own best interests and want to protect
their safety. However, before any final decisions are
made about the reduction in speed limit, the citizens
and officials of Forestville should evaluate all possible
alternatives and causes for the increased number of
accidents over the six-month period as compared to
Elmsford.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 6
This outstanding response begins by noting that the
argument is “well presented.” It then proceeds to
discuss possible alternative explanations for the
increase in car accidents and provides an impressively
full analysis. Alternatives mentioned are that
• the two regions might have drivers of different
ages and experience;
• Forestville’s topography, geography, cars, and/or
roads might contribute to accidents;
• six months might be an insufficient amount of
time for determining that the speed limit is
linked to the accident rate;

• demographics might play a role in auto accidents;
• population and auto density should be considered; and
• the times of day when drivers in the two regions
travel might be relevant.
The points are cogently developed and are linked in
such a way as to create a logically organized critique.
Transitions together with interior connections create
a smoothly integrated presentation. For the most
part, the writer uses language correctly and well and
provides excellent variety in syntax. The minor flaws
(e.g., using “less” instead of “fewer”) do not detract
from the overall high quality of the critique. This is
an impressive 6 paper.
Essay Response – Score 4
At first look, this seems to be a very well presented
arguement. A logical path is followed throughout the
paragraph and the conclusion is expected. However,
upon a second consideration, it is apparent that all
possibilities were not considered when the author
presented his conclusion (or at least that s/he did not
present all of the possibilities). There are numerous
potential explanations for why the number of accidents in Elmsford decreased while the number in
Forestville increased. Although it seems logical to
assume that the difference in the percentage of
accidents was due to the difference in whether or not
the speed limit had been increased during the specified month, this does not necessarily mean that the
speed limit should be reduced back to what it originally was in Forestville. The author does not state
two specific pieces of information that are important
before a conclusion such as the one the author made
is sound. The first is that it is not expressed whether
the speed limits in the two neighboring regions had
had the same speed limit before Forestville’s speed
limit had been increased. If they had originally been
the same, then it is reasonable to conclude that
Forestville’s speed limit should be reduced back to
what it was before the increase. However, if the two
region’s speed limits were initially different, then
such a conclusion can not be made. The second piece
of information that is necessary for the present
argument is the relative number of accidents in each
of the areas prior to the increase in speed limit. For
the author to make the presented conclusion, the
number of accidents should have been approximately
equal prior to the increase in the speed limit in
Forestville. If the two missing pieces of information

61

had been presented and were in the author’s favor,
then the conclusion that the author made would
have been much more sound than it currently is. In
conclusion, the argument is not entirely well reasoned, but given the information that was expressed
in the paragraph, it was presented well, and in a
logical order.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 4
This competent critique claims that there are “numerous potential explanations for why the number of
accidents in Elmsford decreased while the number in

only two points:
• whether the speed limits in the two regions were
originally the same; and
• the number of accidents in each region prior to
Forestville’s raising the speed limit.
Although the response appears at first to be well
developed, there is much less analysis here than the
length would suggest. The first third and last third of
the essay are relatively insubstantial, consisting
mainly of general summary statements (e.g., “A
logical path . . . conclusion is expected” and “If the
two . . . more sound than it currently is”). The real
heart of the critique consists of minimal development
of the two points mentioned above. Therefore,
although two important features of the argument are
analyzed and the writer handles language and syntax
adequately, the lack of substantial development keeps
this critique from earning a score higher than 4.
Essay Response – Score 2
The argument gives statistics of increases in automobile accidents since the speed limit increased six
months ago on the highways of Forestville. The

62

argument also gives a statement of how the neighboring region of Forestville, did not increase or decrease
the speed limit. It remained unchanged and automobile accidents declined slightly during the same sixmonth period. The argument may appeal to those
who have been effected by the increase in accidents,
but it does not give an emotional appeal overall. We
are relying on the authors statistics but we don’t
know where they came from and if they are reliable.
The argument needs more examples and illustrations
to get his point across to more people. It is suggested
that the citizens of Forestville campaign to reduce
Forestville’s speed limit to what it was before the
increase, but it is usually hard to start a campaign.
One person needs to take action. If the author is a
citizen of Forestville, maybe he should take the
initiative.
Reader Commentary for Essay Response – Score 2
This seriously flawed critique presents only one idea
relevant to an analysis of the argument: “The argument needs more examples and illustrations to get his
point across to more people.” Everything else in the
essay is either summarizing the argument, speculating,
or offering advice. The result is a response that is
clearly on topic but that provides no analysis of the
line of reasoning in the argument.
In addition to the lack of analysis, the writing is
weak. The organization is loose, although not illogical, and intended meaning is sometimes unclear (e.g.,
“. . . but it does not give an emotional appeal overall.”). For these reasons, the response deserves a score
of 2 according to the scoring guide.
